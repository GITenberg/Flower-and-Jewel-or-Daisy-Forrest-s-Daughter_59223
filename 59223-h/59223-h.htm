<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>Young Mrs. Fielding opened her dark, heavy-lidded
eyes and gazed thoughtfully about the large, luxurious
chamber, from which every ray of sunshine had been carefully
excluded. As her eyes became accustomed to the
subdued light she saw a fat old negro woman, in a white
cap and apron, dozing placidly in a large rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"Nurse! nurse!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Hi, honey!" and the sleeper wakened with a start,
and waddled up to the bed, with a broad smile on her dark
visage.</p>

<p>"Have I been asleep, nurse? I feel so strange! I seem
to remember that I was sick, and the doctor was here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her faltering words were interrupted by a low chuckle
of satisfaction from the old woman.</p>

<p>"Guess de doctor <i>was</i> here! Guess he put you to
sleep, too; 'case how, he said, no use you suff'rin' sech
cruel pains. Hi, honey! what you reckin? Your trouble
all pas' now, and you de happy mudder o' two de beautifules'
twins dat I eber sot my ole eyes on!"</p>

<p>As the excitable old woman blurted out her joyful news,
Mrs. Fielding's head sunk back heavily on the lace-trimmed
pillow.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, with a deep sigh of relief and joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" echoed the proud old nurse; and she
waddled across to the large double crib and produced two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
tiny infants, which she carried to the bedside on a pillow.
Mrs. Fielding looked up eagerly, and a low cry of delight
broke from her lips.</p>

<p>"What little beauties! Look&mdash;they are opening their
eyes! Oh, one has blue eyes like my husband's, and one
has dark eyes like mine! Are they girls or boys, nurse?"</p>

<p>"Bofe gals!" replied the old woman, with a grunt of
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"And I wanted a boy so much!" the young mother exclaimed,
with a sigh; then, rallying from her disappointment:
"But never mind, nurse; better luck next time.
And, after all, it is perfectly lovely to have twin girls!
They always create a sensation wherever they go. And I
mean to give them such fancy names! Guess, nurse."</p>

<p>"Mary and Marthy, maybe, honey."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" disgustedly. "Nothing of the kind!
Wait&mdash;don't take the darlings away yet."</p>

<p>"But you am talkin' too much, missie."</p>

<p>"I'll be quiet in a minute. Look, nurse"&mdash;she put
out a beautiful white hand and touched each of the babes
in turn&mdash;"this dark one I'll name Jewel, this blue-eyed
one Flower."</p>

<p>"Redikilous! I don't belebe dat Massa Charlie will
'low it," muttered the old woman; and Mrs. Fielding's
eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>"I shall do as I please with my own babies!" she cried,
imperiously.</p>

<p>"All right, honey. In course you'll do as you please&mdash;you
al'ays does," was the soothing response; and then the
old woman carried the twins back to their crib, adding,
wisely: "'Tis a good sign to see sick people cross&mdash;dey's
'most sure to git well. Guess I'll ring de bell and hab
some gruel fotched up fo' her."</p>

<p>But, in the very act of ringing the bell, her hand
dropped to her side, her dark face turned ashen, and a
groan forced its way through her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>A dreadful sound had broken the stillness of the sick-chamber&mdash;the
low, muffled toll of the Tillage church-bell,
telling of an impending funeral.</p>

<p>The beautiful dark face on the pillow lost its proud
smile in a minute, and grew pale with awe.</p>

<p>"Who is dead?" she asked, with a little shiver; but old
Maria did not answer for a moment, and again that low,
muffled toll of the bell struck heavily upon the silence of
the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding repeated her question a little impatiently,
adding, wonderingly:</p>

<p>"I did not know that any one was sick in the village."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;must fotch your gruel, ma'am," cried old
Maria; and she waddled precipitately out of the room,
leaving Mrs. Fielding very much puzzled over her old
servant's deafness.</p>

<p>She lay silent on her pillow, counting those dull, muffled
strokes curiously, and thinking to herself:</p>

<p>"They might have been for me. Oh, how glad I am
that my trouble is over and I am still alive!"</p>

<p>The bell had ceased to toll when Maria came back, with
that ashen look still on her face, carrying the bowl of
gruel somewhat unsteadily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding waited until she finished her light repast,
then said:</p>

<p>"I counted the strokes, Maria, and there were just
nineteen. So it is a young person whom they are going to
bury. Now, tell me at once who it is; you need not be
afraid of agitating me. Even if it is one of my friends, I
will bear it calmly."</p>

<p>"Ay, Lord!" muttered the old nurse, with a grimace
hidden behind her hand. Then she gave Mrs. Fielding a
strange look. "Ma'am, it's none o' your friends at all,
ma'am&mdash;only a poor young gal by the name o' Daisy Forrest."</p>

<p>A low cry shrilled through the room, and old Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
shuddered at the strange sound, it was so distinctly
malicious, so frankly glad.</p>

<p>"Ma'am!" she uttered, indignantly; and Mrs. Fielding
half raised herself on her pillow, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Daisy Forrest dead! My rival dead! Ah, that is
glorious news!"</p>

<p>Maria's old black face turned gray with indignant emotion.</p>

<p>"Hush, missie! You ought to be afraid to talk so.
De good Lord might punish your hardness of heart."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Maria! You know I hated that
woman. You know that she was my rival&mdash;that she held
my husband's heart&mdash;yet you ask me not to be glad she is
dead!"</p>

<p>Her black eyes blazed luridly, and her pale, beautiful
face writhed with jealousy, as, almost breathless, she fell
back upon her pillow, and Maria hurriedly seized a bottle
of camphor and began to bathe her brow and hands.</p>

<p>"Honey, you knowed all dis afore you married my
young master; so, what for you want to take on so now?"
she whimpered, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew it all; but they told me that it was the
way of young men to be wild before marriage&mdash;that he
would cast her off when he became my husband, and hate
her very memory. But it was false; he loved that wicked,
fallen creature best always. He would breathe her name
in his sleep as he lay by my side. He visited her still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, missie; dat pore gal not so bad as dat! She
nebber 'low him to come no more arter he married you,"
interrupted Maria.</p>

<p>"I tell you he did go, Maria! I followed him once,
dressed in boy's clothes. He went in, and I heard him
swearing that he loved her more than ever, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
Her voice choked with fury a moment; then she continued,
wildly: "Dead, thank Heaven&mdash;dead, and out of my way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
forever! Now he will be all my own! But it was very
sudden, was it not, Maria?"</p>

<p>"Very suddint, missie," the old woman answered, sullenly.
"Dere was a leetle baby born night afore last, and
de mudder died afore morning."</p>

<p>"A baby born! My husband's, of course!" the sick
woman cried, furiously; and it seemed as if her jealous
passion would kill her, so terrible was the expression that
distorted her beautiful face as Maria replied, in her sullen
way:</p>

<p>"I ain't gwine to deny dat, missie, for dat 'ud make de
dead gal seem worser dan she wer', and I ain't gwine to
frow no mo' sin an' shame dan possible on dat pore thing
layin' in her coffin wid her baby on her breast."</p>

<p>"So the miserable offspring of shame died, too. That
is good! I hate it with the same hate I had for its
mother!" the infuriated, maddened woman cried out, remorselessly;
but before Maria could utter a single remonstrance,
another sound, and one more startling than the
solemn funeral-bell, broke upon their ears.</p>

<p>It was the loud reverberation of a pistol-shot within the
house.</p>

<p>"Oh! what was that?" shrieked Mrs. Fielding, in terror.</p>

<p>Old Maria did not reply. She was waddling out of the
room as fast as her age and obesity would permit. Obeying
an unerring instinct, she made her way to the library,
and flinging wide the door, crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Massa Charlie! Oh, my pore boy!" she cried out,
in an agony of grief.</p>

<p>He was lying on the floor&mdash;her nurse-child&mdash;her young
master, on whom she doted with true motherly love. His
white, extended hand grasped the small pistol that had
sent that deadly bullet into the breast from which that
ghastly torrent was pouring. His magnificent form lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
rigid; his head, with its short, fair locks, was thrown backward,
and the blue eyes, with their luring, fatal beauty,
were fixed in a dying stare.</p>

<p>She dropped down on her knees&mdash;his poor old black
mammy&mdash;and tried to stanch the torrent of blood with the
ample folds of her skirt, while heart-rending groans burst
from her lips.</p>

<p>"Mammy!" he uttered, faintly.</p>

<p>"Massa Charlie&mdash;darlin'!" she groaned.</p>

<p>"You heard her funeral-bell? How could I live with
her death upon my soul? Oh, my little Daisy, my love, I
broke your heart, and this is my atonement!" he moaned
faintly, remorsefully.</p>

<p>"Massa Charlie, you should have t'ought of her a-lyin'
in yonder wid her babies."</p>

<p>"Ah, mammy, I did, I did! but I was false to her, too.
I am not fit to live. I&mdash;I ruined those two women's lives
with my villainy! I rushed headlong into sin, but I never
dreamed of what was coming to me to-day. I thought I
could go on in my evil ways, but God has punished me.
Mammy, do you think I could live when <i>she</i> is gone out of
the world&mdash;she whom I loved so fondly yet so selfishly?"</p>

<p>"But, Massa Charlie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I ought to have been true to her. I
was weak, unworthy, full of ambition. I let gold and high
position lure me from her side. I was false alike to her
I loved and to her I could not love. Remorse has fastened
its fangs in my heart, and I must die. If I lived, she
would haunt me! How can she rest with <i>that</i> upon her
breast?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor boy! my poor boy! Let me sen' for de
preacher."</p>

<p>"No, mammy; the preacher could not save me now,
after what I have done. Mammy, pray sometimes for my
poor, lost soul&mdash;the coward soul, too weak to do right,
yet not brave enough to bear the ills it wrought. Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
prayers do any good then, I wonder? Ah&mdash;Daisy&mdash;love&mdash;wife!"</p>

<p>A gasp, and the erring soul had fled.</p>

<p>Maria's groan rose simultaneously with a terrible cry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding had dragged herself to the library and
heard all. She spurned the dead body with her foot.</p>

<p>"He died with her name upon his lips," she hissed,
"and I am his wedded wife!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>All this was long ago, and for seventeen years the grass
had been growing over the neglected graves of Daisy Forrest
and Charlie Fielding. The woman who bore his
name, the mother of his children, had long ago fled from
the little Southern village that had been the scene of such
blighting scandal and bitter tragedy, and made her home
many miles away from that hated spot, far enough, she
hoped, to bring up her children out of all knowledge or
hearing of the bitter past.</p>

<p>Into her new home and her new life none of her old
household accompanied her, save old Maria. Since her
husband's death the cruel Civil War had swept over the
land and freed the slaves that belonged to the heiress,
whose gold had tempted Charlie Fielding to sin. Every
one deserted their mistress gladly, none remaining but
Maria, who had belonged to her husband. She remained,
although not for love of her mistress. She could not desert
Massa Charlie's children, she said.</p>

<p>These two, Jewel and Flower, as their mother persisted
in calling them, had grown up so beautiful and charming
that no one could decide to which belonged the palm of
greater beauty. Paris himself would have been in despair,
and the golden apple must have been divided, or never
awarded to either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Fancy a brunette of the most decided type with a beautiful,
passionate face, a cloud of waving dark hair, and eyes
of starry brightness. By her tall, queenly figure place
one equally lovely, yet as different in her type as flowers
from jewels, dawn from sunset, or day from night.</p>

<p>An exquisite form, less tall and full than Jewel's, but
perfectly proportioned, and with a fairy-like grace impossible
to describe. Blue eyes of the brightest, rarest tint,
and hair that fell to her waist in loose bright curls of that
rich golden hue so dear to the artist's heart. Small, perfectly
molded features and a dazzling complexion received
a touch of piquancy from the delicate yet decided arch of
the slender brows and the thick curling lashes both several
degrees darker than her hair. Both girls had small hands
and feet, and possessed every attribute of beauty. It was
no wonder that strangers could not decide which was the
lovelier, when their own mother was puzzled over the
question.</p>

<p>There were moments&mdash;few and far between&mdash;when Mrs.
Fielding almost said to herself that it was Flower to whom
she would award the palm of beauty. But these were the
moments when she was softened by a memory of the love
she had borne Charlie Fielding before that last hour when
her hot jealousy and hate had made her curse him as he
lay dead at her feet.</p>

<p>But these softened moments were few and short.</p>

<p>"I am mad, mad!" she would cry, coming out of these
spells as though from an abhorred trance. "I ought to
hate Flower Fielding&mdash;ought to hate my own child, because
she has her father's face."</p>

<p>There were times when she was half maddened by the
memory of the past, by the thought of the horrible
humiliation and pain she had endured long ago&mdash;alas!
that she endured still. The old hot resentment and jealousy
burned still in her heart, turned her blood to fire,
and fevered her pulse. The fierce aspiration breathed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
her husband's dead body for vengeance on the two who
had blasted her life was fresh on her lips still.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was with her the night long, in dreaming or waking,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It abided in loathing, when daylight was breaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The burden of bitterness in her! Behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All her days were become as a tale that is told,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And she said to her sight, 'No good thing shalt thou see,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the noonday is turned to darkness in me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One very interesting event had occurred in the Fielding
family since their twins had entered upon their seventeenth
birthday.</p>

<p>Faithful old Maria, after bringing them through their
childish ailments up to the years of girlhood, had bought
a cabin near by with her savings of years, and "gone to
herself," as she expressed it. Silly old soul, she had been
beguiled by the attractions of a young mulatto buck who
had his eye on her small savings, and she married him and
settled down to married life with all its joys and woes,
which in her case proved chiefly the latter.</p>

<p>Jewel and Flower, who dearly loved their black mammy,
sympathized very much with her ludicrous love affair, and
even with the access of religion she acquired when she
"jined de shoutin' Methody, for de comfort o' my soul,
chillen, for dat dissipated Sam 'most sen' my soul to de
debbil!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>With the tragic story that surrounded their birth, and
the tragic elements that lay slumbering in their own natures,
it was most unfortunate that Jewel and Flower
should have lost their heart to the same man.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith was a handsome young man of about
twenty-three years, tall, and finely proportioned, with a
very attractive face. He had a broad, intellectual white
brow, crowned by wavy, dark-brown hair, glorious, brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
eyes that could look dangerously tender, and his firm yet
sweet lips were half hidden beneath a silky-brown mustache,
whose long ends curled around a well-formed chin
cleft by a charming dimple.</p>

<p>He was spending his vacation from college at the sea-side
resort where the Fieldings lived, and he had made the
acquaintance of Jewel and Flower in a most romantic
fashion, having saved the life of Jewel one day when her
pretty little boat had overturned in deep water. Swimming
boldly out to the sinking girl, he had succeeded in
saving her just as the pretty dark head was disappearing
for the last time under the treacherous waves. Then,
righting the overturned boat, he succeeded in getting into
it with his exhausted companion, and rowed back to shore.</p>

<p>This little incident had made Laurie Meredith a hero in
the eyes of the beautiful twin sisters. They vied with each
other in gratitude, and even the cold, indifferent Mrs.
Fielding could not choose but regard the brave young gentleman
with favor.</p>

<p>Jewel fell in love in the most approved novel fashion
with her handsome preserver, and for a short while it
seemed as if he returned the compliment. The most delicious
flatteries fell from his lips, the most daring glances
shone from his glorious brown eyes. He was often by her
side and Flower's, and he said to himself that it would be
quite in keeping with this romance if he should make
dark-eyed Jewel Fielding his adored bride.</p>

<p>Then a change came gradually over him. He began to
grow impartial in his attentions to the two girls; he began
to think in secret of Flower's beautiful blue eyes and
golden hair. When he parted from her he would press
the white hand tightly in his own, and from thinking that
he could not decide which was more beautiful, he began to
perceive that if one must decide he should say it was
Flower. Then the situation began to grow embarrassing.
He wanted to make love to Flower, but he realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
he had been too imprudent with her sister. He had responded
too readily to her coquettish advances, and he
was afraid of the lightning that could flash upon occasion
from those night-black eyes.</p>

<p>"Confound my luck! The girl thinks that I belong
to her because I saved her life. I wish it had been blue-eyed
Flower who owed me that sweet debt of gratitude,"
he thought, uneasily.</p>

<p>He was frank and noble, and he despised anything underhand
or mean, but he could no more help making surreptitious
love to Flower than he could help breathing.
When in the presence of both girls he tried to be quite impartial
in his words and looks, that Jewel might not have
the pain of seeing her sister preferred before her, but if the
dark-eyed beauty left the room for one moment, he would
be sure to make some excuse to get by Flower, that he
might gaze into her eyes with that long, sweet look before
which her glance fell so shyly, while the lovely color
flushed up high in her cheeks. Sometimes he ventured to
touch the soft, white hand, and by its tremor he realized
that the shy, gentle girl was not wholly indifferent to his
love.</p>

<p>His passion began at length to find relief in that outlet
for the lover's heart&mdash;poetry. Passionate "sonnets to his
lady's eyebrow" began to overflow perfumed sheets of
note-paper. These found their way to Flower in all the
romantic methods a lover's fertile brain could invent.</p>

<p>Jewel was on the alert. A jealous pang had begun to
tear her passionate heart. She watched her sister and
Laurie Meredith with silent distrust. Little by little the
bitter truth began to dawn on her mind.</p>

<p>A very fury of wrath swept over her, and she found it
impossible to conceal her anger. So one day, when they
were walking together by the sea-shore, the gathering
storm burst fiercely upon her sister's golden head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cruel, deceitful girl, you are trying to take my lover
from me! Are you not ashamed of your treachery?"</p>

<p>"Jewel! Sister!"</p>

<p>"Do not call me your sister unless you are going to
stop trying to win Laurie from me, unless you are going
to give him back to me!" Jewel cried, angrily, flying
into a passion, her dark eyes blazing with jealousy.</p>

<p>Her sister's answer only added fuel to the fire of her
wrath, although it was spoken gently, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Dear, I did not know he belonged to you. I thought
you were only friends."</p>

<p>Jewel stamped her little foot furiously upon the sand.</p>

<p>"Only friends! Why, he saved my life&mdash;and afterward
he fell in love with me! But you have tried to win him
from me! Ah, I have watched you, you artful girl, and
I hate you&mdash;hate you for what you have done!"</p>

<p>Flower stood still, her fair face paling in the afternoon
sunshine, her sweet, red lips beginning to quiver.</p>

<p>"Sister, dear, you wrong me bitterly. Not for worlds
would I have tried to take him from you. But he told me
there was nothing between you, that he was free to love
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lie! a lie!" Jewel cried out, furiously. "He won
my heart by his tender looks and words; he let me believe
him all my own, and&mdash;oh!" she cried, choking with rage
and grief, and clapping her hands to her convulsed throat.</p>

<p>Flower sprung forward to throw caressing arms about
her, but was so rudely repulsed that she staggered, and
would have fallen upon the sands had not Laurie Meredith
suddenly appeared upon the scene and caught her in his
arms, clung to him convulsively a moment, then
drew back and stood apart from him with a look of proud
pain on her beautiful face.</p>

<p>"Ladies, I think I heard my name mentioned? May I
ask&mdash;" he began, courteously; but Jewel, who was gazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
at him with burning eyes, sprung between him and her
sister, and cried out, in passionate, defiant tones:</p>

<p>"Yes, we were speaking of you, Laurie Meredith! We
were saying that you had tried to trifle with both our
hearts. Call me unwomanly if you will, but I must speak
out now. This cruel farce can go on no longer. You
have made love to my sister and you have made love to
me. You have in this cruel fashion won both our hearts.
Now choose between us&mdash;between Jewel and Flower!"</p>

<p>If she had cherished one lingering hope that he would
turn to her, she was cruelly disappointed. He went over
to Flower and silently took her hand. Jewel gave them
one furious look, then walked silently from the scene.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>Laurie Meredith drew a long sigh of relief, and bent
tenderly over Flower.</p>

<p>"My darling, shall it be as she says? Will you indeed
be mine?" he questioned, tenderly.</p>

<p>She trembled and shrunk away.</p>

<p>"I can not make my sister wretched. Ah, Laurie, if
you have indeed made love to her, as she declares, will
you not go back to her and try to love her again? She
will forgive you this if you beg her very hard. And she
is so beautiful it will be easy to love her again."</p>

<p>He tried to explain to her that he had never been in
love with Jewel at all, and that he had never made love to
her&mdash;unless she counted a few pretty compliments and
tender glances as words of love. She found it easy to believe
him, since her own observations tended to prove the
truthfulness of his words.</p>

<p>"I will own that I might have loved her if I had never
met you, my darling," he said. "She is very beautiful
and charming, but, Flower, you are my queen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The fair face flushed rosily at his words, but she held
herself aloof from his embrace.</p>

<p>"Poor Jewel!" she murmured, in the tones of a pitying
angel. "Ah, Laurie, perhaps if I would go away
somewhere you might learn to love her after all!"</p>

<p>"So you do not care for me, Flower? Then it is a pity
I ever saw you. I wish that I had given my heart to your
sister; then my love might have been appreciated," the
young man sighed, dejectedly; and his sorrow went to her
tender heart. Very timidly she laid her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"I do care for you," she said, in flute-like tones,
through which ran a tremor of deep tenderness. "But,
ah, my poor sister! I am so sorry for her disappointment!"</p>

<p>"She will soon get over it," he said, drawing her to his
breast and kissing the lovely, tremulous lips.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she whispered, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my darling. I dare say she has got over it
already, since she forced me so coolly to make choice between
you two. She will be ready to laugh with you to-night
at the thought of your being actually engaged to be
married."</p>

<p>"If I thought so I would say 'yes' at once; but I am
almost afraid. Fancy one's sister being in love with one's
husband!" Flower said, doubtfully and distressedly.</p>

<p>He laughed at her fears.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Jewel has too much good sense to go on
caring for me now. Her fancy will soon blow over," he
said; and then he clasped and kissed her again with a passionate
fervor.</p>

<p>"I shall call on your mother to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"And in the meantime, darling, wear this ring to remind
you that you belong to Laurie."</p>

<p>He slipped the diamond ring from his finger and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it on hers, and in a few moments they parted, and Flower
sped swiftly homeward.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and Jewel was on the front porch
alone, making a lovely picture among the clematis vines
in her white dress and scarlet sash. Her face looked so
calm and indifferent that lovely little Flower took heart
to ask, timidly:</p>

<p>"Do you love him yet, Jewel, or can you forget him
now since everything has proved different from what you
believed?"</p>

<p>"I despise him!" Jewel answered, vindictively; and
Flower faltered, hopefully:</p>

<p>"Then you will not care if I become engaged to him,
dear sister?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I care? He is nothing to me! If
you choose to take a heartless flirt for your husband, and
run the risk of having him desert you for some other fair
face, as he deserted me for you, why, you have my consent!"
Jewel answered, proudly, and with such well-acted
carelessness that Flower told herself that her lover was
right. Jewel would soon forget her disappointment.</p>

<p>She hung around her sister several moments, but Jewel
took no notice, and at length Flower asked, timidly:</p>

<p>"Where is mamma?"</p>

<p>"She has gone over to Mammy Maria's house," Jewel
replied, composedly.</p>

<p>"Why did she go?"</p>

<p>"Sam came to tell her that his wife had had some sort
of a stroke and was dying. She kept calling for mamma, saying
that she had a secret to tell her before she died, so she
went at once," Jewel answered, speaking as indifferently
as if the dying woman had been a stranger, instead of the
devoted nurse whose ample breast had pillowed her childish
years with tenderer care than she had ever received
from her half-demented mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>But Flower began to sob piteously for her poor old
mammy, begging Jewel to go with her to her bedside.</p>

<p>"I would not go for a kingdom! I'm afraid of a dying
person. I never saw any one die in my life. And you
can not go, either, for mamma said you must stay here
with me!" Jewel answered, selfishly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>Flower stayed up until midnight waiting for her mother's
return and for news of old Maria, but at last she succumbed
to anxiety and weariness, and fell asleep on the
sofa. The house-maid found her here presently and carried
her off to bed.</p>

<p>The first thing she heard next morning was that old
Maria had died at the turn of the night, and that her
mother had come home soon after and retired to her
room, giving orders that she was not to be disturbed in
the morning.</p>

<p>Pretty Flower shed some bitter tears over the death of
the dearly loved old nurse, then she began to long to comfort
her mother in her sorrow.</p>

<p>"Poor dear, she must have loved Mammy Maria very
much. I will just peep in and see if she is sleeping
soundly," she thought, and went on tiptoe to her mother's
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding was not in bed at all. She was sitting
bolt upright in a chair, and when Flower came gliding in,
her mother's aspect struck her with such fear and horror
that she could not repress a cry of distress. For a moment
it appeared to her that a stranger was sitting there in her
mother's chair.</p>

<p>At a first glance Mrs. Fielding looked like an old woman.
Her handsome face was drawn, haggard, and gray,
and the long tresses of hair that fell round her shoulders
had turned to snowy-white since yesterday. The only attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of youth remaining was in her large, brilliant dark
eyes that burned with an unnatural and feverish glitter,
betokening a terrible inward excitement.</p>

<p>Her lips were working nervously, and low, incoherent
words issued from them like the ravings of a lunatic.</p>

<p>At that awe-struck cry from Flower's lips the terribly
changed woman looked quickly up, and her face grew, if
possible, more ghastly than before. She threw out both
hands, crying hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Go out of my sight this moment!"</p>

<p>"But, mamma&mdash;" began the startled girl.</p>

<p>"Go, I say&mdash;and at once!" Mrs. Fielding cried out, in
such harsh and threatening accents that poor Flower fled
affrighted from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall she encountered Jewel, dressed for walking.
She ran up to her eagerly, crying out:</p>

<p>"Oh, sister, our black mammy died last night, and
poor mamma is almost crazed with grief. Her beautiful
black hair has turned white as snow, and her face is like
an old woman's. And," with a choking sob, "she drove
me out of her room."</p>

<p>"I will go to her!" cried Jewel, turning toward her
mother's room.</p>

<p>The next moment she was gazing with horrified eyes at
the terrible physical wreck that had so startled poor
Flower, who was now cowering at the door, afraid to
enter.</p>

<p>"Go, leave me!" Mrs. Fielding cried, angrily, to
Jewel.</p>

<p>"Mamma!"</p>

<p>"Go!" she reiterated, wildly; but Jewel stood her
ground like a statue.</p>

<p>"I am not going until I know the meaning of this,"
she replied, firmly. "Why, mamma, your black hair has
turned snowy-white in a few hours! You have become an
old woman since last night!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding caught up a loose tress of hair from her
shoulder and stared at it with dilated eyes. A bitter cry
broke from her lips.</p>

<p>"What does it matter if my hair has turned to snow?
My heart changed to fire long since. Go, girl, leave me
to myself!"</p>

<p>Jewel made no sign of obeying. She said, curiously:</p>

<p>"So our old nurse is dead, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Dead&mdash;yes! I wish she had died twenty years ago! I
wish she had never been born!" Mrs. Fielding burst out,
furiously.</p>

<p>"But I thought you were fond of her, mamma!" Jewel
exclaimed, in momentary wonder. Then a sudden light
broke over her mind. "Ah, I remember now! Sam said
she had a secret to tell you. Was it that secret which
turned you against Maria?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding gave a startled look, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Sam is a fool! There was no secret!"</p>

<p>"And she had nothing to tell you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of any consequence. The old woman was in
her dotage, and since she joined the Methodist Church she
had persuaded herself that she was the vilest of sinners,
and that she must confess all the petty sins of her life to
me, or she would go to perdition. But there was nothing&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"But you said just now that you wished she had never
been born, and your hair is white all in a few hours.
There must be some awful reason for that," persisted
Jewel, her curiosity thoroughly aroused; but Mrs. Fielding
turned upon her defiantly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing, I tell you, except that I have been
maddened with neuralgia all night, and that is reason
enough for the change in my hair. Now go, and remember,
no more questions about Maria's foolish secrets. Let
them be buried in her grave!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Jewel saw that the excited woman could bear no more,
and retreated, muttering as she went:</p>

<p>"Shall I send for the doctor?"</p>

<p>"No; oh, no! I only want rest. I shall be all right
presently. Flower, why are you hanging about the door?
Go at once, as I bid you just now!"</p>

<p>The door closed between her and her startled, wounded
daughters, and she flung herself back in her chair, muttering,
fiercely:</p>

<p>"Oh, how horrible it is! He was a fiend, no less; and
all that he did before seems light in comparison to this!
Ah, to think how I have been fooled and wronged&mdash;it is
enough to turn a saint into a devil! There is only one
comfort left. Let me find out the truth, and I will take
vengeance on them in their graves by torturing her&mdash;I
will; I swear it!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jewel had been on her way to a clairvoyant's when
Flower met her in the hall. On leaving her mother's
room she went on to seek the wonderful woman who was
reputed to be able to read the past and the future. The
beautiful girl had spent a sleepless night, brooding over
what she chose to consider her wrongs, and she was determined
to thwart Laurie Meredith's design of marrying her
sister if she could possibly accomplish it. Thinking that
some knowledge of future events might be of assistance in
her aims, she decided to consult the clairvoyant.</p>

<p>She remained almost two hours at the humble home of
the fortune-teller, and when she came out her face was
flushed, and her eyes sparkled with a hopeful light.</p>

<p>The strange woman had said to her:</p>

<p>"Your mother has a carefully hidden secret. Find it
out, and you shall triumph over your enemies."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>True to his word, Laurie Meredith called at the home
of Flower next day to ask her mother's consent to his betrothal
to the lovely girl who had won his heart.</p>

<p>"My darling, what is it?" he cried, eagerly, as he
drew her to his breast. "You have not repented your
promise to be mine?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she whispered; and he soon learned the
story of Maria's death, Mrs. Fielding's terrible excitement,
and her refusal to see any one&mdash;even her daughters.</p>

<p>"It is very strange. One would not have supposed she
would be so fond of her old servant as to turn gray with
grief," he said, feeling that there was something mysterious
about Mrs. Fielding's case, yet not dreaming of the
terrible influence that mystery was fated to bear upon his
own future.</p>

<p>Flower was so frightened at her mother's condition that
she dared not go to her and tell her that Laurie Meredith
wished to see her. She persuaded her lover to wait until
her mother should be herself again.</p>

<p>"Or until poor Maria's funeral is over, at least. Then
she will be calmer and more composed, Laurie, dear."</p>

<p>He promised most unwillingly. He was eager to have
it all settled at once&mdash;to make sure that there would be
no opposition offered by Flower's mother. A dim fear
that Jewel would influence Mrs. Fielding to reject his suit
had haunted him since last night, although not for worlds
would he have hinted it to Flower, who was so sensitive
about accepting his love, on account of her sister.</p>

<p>"You know, sweet one, I must go away soon," he said.
"I had a letter from my father this morning, and he
wishes me to go abroad to finish my education in a German
university."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Laurie&mdash;so far away!" she cried, and clung to
him, pale and trembling, a mist of tears rising to her
lovely blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Only for one little year, darling," he said, tenderly.
"Then I shall return to claim my little bride; for my father
is rich, and we need not wait as if I had to make my
own way in the world."</p>

<p>"A year of absence!" Flower went on, with wild dismay,
tears overflowing her beautiful cheeks.</p>

<p>She laid her golden head upon her lover's breast and
sobbed bitterly, as if with a prescience of the cruel fate
that overshadowed her fair young life.</p>

<p>He was quite as sorry to go as she was over his going,
and when he saw her grief a wild idea came to him. Why
not marry Flower before he went away, and take her with
him to Germany?</p>

<p>He whispered his thought to her, and at first she was
quite startled. Her beautiful face was crimson with
blushes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I could not do that! Besides, mamma would
never consent!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>But the idea had taken strong hold of Laurie Meredith's
fancy. He loved his blue-eyed little Flower so ardently
that he could not bear the thought of leaving her while
he went abroad. Something might happen. She might
forget him, might be won from him by another. She was
so young and lovely, who could tell what would happen?</p>

<p>He painted to her in low, sweet, eloquent murmurs, his
love, his doubts and fears, while she protested her fidelity
with girlish vehemence.</p>

<p>At last he dropped the subject, but only to renew it at
their next meeting, and in the end he won her consent
that if her mother were willing she would marry him before
he went away.</p>

<p>The day after the colored Methodist church had buried
old Maria, after a stirring funeral sermon, Laurie walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
home with the two girls from the little burying-ground,
where they had witnessed the funeral obsequies of the departed,
and he was touched by the honest grief of the twin
sisters over the death of their good old nurse.</p>

<p>Jewel seemed to have forgotten the episode of two days
ago, she was so pale and sad, and her manner toward
Laurie Meredith was so calm and unembarrassed. Both
Flower and her lover were reassured by it, and believed
that she was sorry for her passionate outburst, and anxious
to have them forget it.</p>

<p>Alas, neither one dreamed of the tornado of passion that
was heaving the breast of the beautiful brunette.</p>

<p>When they reached the house, and Laurie Meredith
asked eagerly to see Mrs. Fielding alone, she guessed instantly
at his desire, and determined to hear all that
passed between her mother and her sister's lover.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Fielding had not attended the funeral of her old
servant. She had kept her room several days, under the
plea of illness, in order to lend color to the assertion that
her hair had changed color from neuralgia.</p>

<p>But she had managed to moderate the angry impatience
that had so wounded and startled her beautiful daughters,
and now permitted them to spend a short while with her
daily, placing a strong command over herself that she
might endure their presence without raving over the storm
of anger that filled her heart.</p>

<p>So when Flower came to her that day to ask her to give
Laurie Meredith an interview she did not refuse, only sent
the girl away, saying that she would be down in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>When the door shut between her and Flower, she stood
there startled and wild-eyed.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Is he going to ask me for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of my daughters? My daughters!&mdash;ah, I forgot!" she
cried, wildly; and a swift determination came to her that
neither of the girls should be permitted to marry until she
found out something which was now almost driving her
mad with doubt.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith could not repress a start of surprise
when she appeared before him, she was so ghastly pale,
and her large, black eyes seemed to fairly burn in her pale
face. The contrast, too, of her white hair with her black
eyes, and her black silk dress was startling, since he had
seen her but a few days ago, when her abundant tresses
had in them but a few scattering threads of gray.</p>

<p>He hastened to place a chair for her, and to express his
regrets over her illness.</p>

<p>She accepted his courtesy with a slight melancholy bow,
and as she sunk into the chair, said huskily:</p>

<p>"Be brief, if you please, as I am still suffering with my
head."</p>

<p>So instead of approaching the subject in a roundabout
way, as he had intended, he was compelled to blurt it out
abruptly, while shrinking under the cold stare of supercilious
surprise she fixed on his flushed face.</p>

<p>She listened in unmoved silence to his statement that he
loved Flower, that his love was returned, and that he
wished to marry her in a very short time and take her
abroad with him.</p>

<p>When he ended she replied with a curt and decided refusal
that stung his pride most bitterly.</p>

<p>But for the sake of his love he tried to be very patient,
and courteous. He told her that he was of good birth,
that his father was rich and indulgent.</p>

<p>"I can give you letters. I do not even ask you to take
my word," he insisted.</p>

<p>"If you were a prince and heir to a throne, my answer
would be the same," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>He looked at her in wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can not understand you, Mrs. Fielding. Do you
think that Flower is too young to marry?"</p>

<p>"No. At least, that has nothing to do with my refusal.
I will tell you frankly, Mr. Meredith, what I mean, and
that will save further discussion. I shall never permit
either of my daughters to marry."</p>

<p>He was so stunned by astonishment that he could not
speak for a moment; then he gasped out:</p>

<p>"Your reasons?"</p>

<p>"They are my own, and I do not choose to disclose
them!" she haughtily replied.</p>

<p>"But you may change your mind some time, Mrs.
Fielding. In the meantime, will you permit Flower to
correspond with me while I am away?" he asked, feeling
sure that she would not always cling to this preposterous
resolution.</p>

<p>"I shall never change my mind, Mr. Meredith, and I
can not consent to your request. And I desire that you
hold no further communication with my&mdash;with Flower,"
rising as if to signify that the interview was closed.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed proudly, and he asked, almost bitterly:</p>

<p>"You will permit me to see Flower once more at least,
and bid her good-bye?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and then said, condescendingly:</p>

<p>"Yes, you may see her, but only this once. Do not
call again, as you will not be admitted. Remember also
that you must not intrude on my daughters in their walks,
or I shall confine them to the house. I will now send
Flower to you, and you may tell her what I have said."</p>

<p>"She does not mean it, she could not be so cruel.
Never to see you again, not even to hear from you while
you are away! Oh, Laurie, I can not bear it! I will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
down upon my knees to mamma and beg her to have
mercy upon me, for I should die if I were parted from
you!" Flower wept, impetuously.</p>

<p>"Darling!" he cried, passionately, and clasped her in
his arms, raining fondest kisses on the fair face and golden
hair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding's strange looks and words had inspired
him with the belief that she was crazed by some mysterious
trouble, and he trembled at the thought of leaving his
loving little Flower to her doubtful care. He was angry,
too, at the scorn with which she had treated him, and a
mad resolve was forming swiftly in his mind.</p>

<p>"Darling, you say that you will speak to her. Perhaps
she will listen to you and consent to make us happy. But
she has forbidden me to come here again, or to join you
in your daily walks. So how am I to find out her decision?"
he whispered, fearful lest his ordinary voice
might be overheard, and it was well that he took that precaution,
for Jewel was near at hand, listening with bated
breath to catch every word.</p>

<p>Flower whispered softly back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could send you a note, Laurie, dear."</p>

<p>"It might be intercepted," he replied, as cautiously.</p>

<p>"Could you not manage to meet me for a few minutes,
Flower, without any one knowing?"</p>

<p>She thought a moment, then agreed to his request, and
an appointment was made to meet for a few minutes that
evening in the garden. Flower was the most obedient of
daughters, but feeling that her mother was entirely too
severe in this case, her impetuous young spirit prompted
her to rebellion.</p>

<p>When her lover had gone Flower sought her mother's
room, and with all her powers of persuasion tried to move
that hard heart. But she might just as well have cried to
a rock. Mrs. Fielding remained harsh and unyielding, and
at last ordered the unhappy girl from her presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Longing for sympathy in her trouble, Flower sought
her twin sister and poured out the story with which Jewel
was already acquainted through her eavesdropping propensities.</p>

<p>Jewel listened in cold silence, and her dark eyes beamed
with triumph as she said at last:</p>

<p>"So you and Laurie Meredith did not gain anything by
your treachery to me!"</p>

<p>Flower started and looked at Jewel. Her beautiful
features were transformed by a malicious sneer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jewel! did you do it? Did you prejudice mamma
against Laurie, and make her refuse his request?" she exclaimed,
piteously.</p>

<p>"No, I did not do that, Flower. So, you see, I am not
so bad as you think me; for I am as much puzzled as you
can be over mamma's strange declaration," Jewel said,
truthfully, for she was indeed amazed, though overjoyed,
at the firm stand her mother had taken.</p>

<p>She said to herself, with a sneer, that when she chose
to marry she would do so, in spite of all the mothers in
the world; but she believed that Flower was formed in a
gentler mold than she was, and that she would not dare
transgress her parent's command.</p>

<p>Perhaps she might not, if she had been left to herself;
but she had a fervent, impassioned lover, who could not
endure the thought of leaving his sweet little love behind
him, in the care of a mother who had shown herself so
heartless and unnatural; and when Flower met him that
night, in the odorous stillness and darkness of the flower-garden,
he proposed that she should elope with him.</p>

<p>"You could slip out some time and go to the next village
with me, could you not?" he entreated. "Then we
could be privately married, and you could go back to your
mother's and stay with her until the time for us to steal
away, my darling."</p>

<p>She was startled and frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Laurie! I could not&mdash;I am afraid!" sighed the
poor child.</p>

<p>"Then we may as well say farewell forever," Laurie
Meredith answered, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"But you will come back in a year, Laurie; perhaps
mamma will change her mind in that time," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she may," he answered, bitterly. "But it
is much more likely, Flower, that she will spirit you away
from here, and cover up her tracks so cleverly that I shall
never find you again. Do you realize that, my darling?"</p>

<p>A frightened sob told that she did, and in the fear of
losing her lover forever Flower was at length persuaded
to do as he wished.</p>

<p>They made all their plans for the marriage and elopement,
and then Flower stole back to the house to spend a
sleepless night thinking of the rebellious step she was
about to take, and trembling at the thought of her mother's
and sister's anger when they should find that she had
fled with her handsome lover.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>Absorbed in her efforts to find out her mother's secret,
Jewel Fielding did not watch her twin sister as closely as
she might otherwise have done, so Flower had many opportunities
of meeting her lover in secret, while Jewel,
who knew that her sister was usually docile and obedient,
did not suspect that the lovely girl was secretly transgressing
her mother's commands and meeting Laurie
Meredith every night in the pretty grounds that surrounded
the house.</p>

<p>But a baleful chance brought her to a knowledge of the
truth.</p>

<p>She had tried by every hint and innuendo at her command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to worry her mother's secret out of her possession,
but vainly. Mrs. Fielding could not be surprised into a
betrayal of herself, and betrayed the bitterest anger and
impatience whenever Jewel referred to the subject. Indeed,
she had changed greatly toward her daughters.
From loving them in the most devoted maternal fashion
she seemed at times to dislike and almost hate them. She
spent the greater part of her time alone in her room, refusing
their company, and brooding bitterly over the revelation
made to her by old Maria when on her death-bed.</p>

<p>So Jewel grew wrathful and impatient, and decided to
resort to the clairvoyant again for assistance in her design
of turning Laurie Meredith against her fair sister and
winning him herself.</p>

<p>Not wishing to be seen entering the house of the fortune-teller,
who bore a very questionable character, she
waited until twilight, and slipped out by the back way,
plainly dressed, and with her head shrouded in a thick
veil.</p>

<p>Her way lay past the cabin of the deceased Maria, the
small property having now fallen to the dissipated Sam,
who was making "ducks and drakes" of it as fast as possible,
having been on a prolonged spree ever since his old
wife drew her last breath.</p>

<p>A dozen or more of thick and well-grown oak-trees
formed a dense grove about the little place, and Jewel
caught her breath with awe as she hurried past, dreading
to see the shade of her departed nurse emerge from the
gloom.</p>

<p>Hark, what was that?</p>

<p>Her mother's voice!</p>

<p>It issued from among the trees near the front door. It
was speaking sharply, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Maria told me, Sam, that there were papers in a box
in her chest to which I was entitled, and which referred
solely to me and my daughters. You drunken rascal, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
have hidden them, and pretended that they were gone in
order to extort money from me!"</p>

<p>Sam, who was now almost sober, was heard vehemently
protesting his innocence.</p>

<p>He wished he might die if there were any papers or any
box in Maria's old chest. The old creature had been in
her dotage and imagined it. Mrs. Fielding ought not to
pay any attention to what the crazy old woman had said.</p>

<p>"Come, Sam, name your price for the box of papers.
I understand your game, and I am ready to pay well for
them. Let us close up the bargain and be done with it.
This makes three times I have come to you on the same
subject, and I am getting tired of your shilly-shallying,"
Mrs. Fielding cried, sharply and angrily, while Jewel,
crouching down close to the fence, listened to every word,
hoping to gain a clew to her mother's mysterious secret.</p>

<p>But she was disappointed, for Mrs. Fielding was forced
to go away at last unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Neither bribes, persuasions nor threats could get anything
out of the stubborn widower.</p>

<p>It was true that Sam had the box of papers, but being
exceedingly illiterate and suspicious regarding white folks,
he imagined the papers to be deeds or something relating
to the property he had inherited from Maria, and feared
that if he gave them up he might lose all, for had not
Maria become bitterly incensed at him for his trifling
ways, and declared that she would not leave him a cent
when she died?</p>

<p>So, being unable to read the papers himself, and afraid
to let any one else see them, Sam took refuge in a lie, to
which he clung with dogged persistence, while chuckling
to himself over his cleverness in outwitting the white folk
who wanted to cheat him out of his cabin and five-acre
lot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding's rapid footsteps died away in the dim distance,
and Jewel rose from her crouching position cautiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and leaned her arms on the low fence, debating
with herself whether she should approach Sam or not, and
make an effort to learn the strange secret which had
changed her mother so terribly.</p>

<p>A certain terror she had always had of the brutal,
drunken scamp restrained the ardor of her desire. She
would not trust herself with him near this lonely cabin,
over which darkness was now settling, and which was some
distance from any other human habitation. She would
wait until to-morrow, and in the broad light of day try to
cajole the important papers out of his keeping, for she felt
sure that they related to her mother's secret.</p>

<p>She waited for Sam to go in, dreading lest he should
hear her footsteps in the road and pursue her. Then,
too, she had decided to return home instead of seeking out
the clairvoyant, and she did not wish to start back yet lest
she should overtake her mother.</p>

<p>So she concluded to wait a few moments, and that slight
delay was fatal to the happiness of beautiful Flower.</p>

<p>A man's footsteps came along the road, and she held
her breath in fear; but the darkness hid her like a thick
veil, and he went on toward the grove of trees, losing
himself in the dense shadow.</p>

<p>"Sam!" he called, cautiously, and she gave a violent
start.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith!</p>

<p>It was indeed Flower's lover, and as Sam replied to his
call, he said:</p>

<p>"You delivered those two letters so cleverly to Miss
Flower that I wish you to take her another in the same
cautious manner&mdash;to wait for a reply, and bring it to me
at once. Can you do so?"</p>

<p>The clink of gold in his hand made Sam reply eagerly
in the affirmative.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>Several months went by, and the fate that hung so
heavily over Flower Fielding's beautiful head lowered
more and more darkly, until life became a burden almost
too heavy to be borne.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith had gone away on the night before the
one appointed for their elopement, and nothing had ever
been heard of him since.</p>

<p>At first Flower had feared that something had happened
to her lover, and in her desperation she had personally
made inquiry at the hotel where he had boarded, and the
clerk had told her that Mr. Meredith had settled his bill
that evening and had his trunk sent down to the boat,
saying that he was going home, as his father had written
for him to come.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," Flower said, falteringly. She saw
the clerk's look of astonishment, and added: "Mr. Meredith
lent me some books to read, and I would have liked
to return them, but I did not know he was going away so
soon. Have you any idea where I could send them?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not, miss; but I dare say Mr. Meredith
desired you to keep them," returned the resplendent
young clerk, with an admiring glance at the lovely young
girl, which made her color hotly and immediately turn
away.</p>

<p>"He will come back, or he will write soon and explain
why he went away so suddenly. He may have been called
away by a telegram. Perhaps some of his relatives are
dead," she thought; and for several weeks she waited, expecting
his return, or a letter at least.</p>

<p>Still she could not help feeling indignant at the way in
which he had gone.</p>

<p>"He might have sent a note to let me know," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
thought; but as time passed on without any explanation,
she resolved to write to him and ask him why he had
treated her so unkindly.</p>

<p>He had given her a card one day with his Northern address
upon it, and she had put it away carefully in her little
rosewood writing-desk.</p>

<p>But when she went to look for it the card was gone.
Something else was gone, too&mdash;a paper that Laurie had
given her to keep&mdash;an important document.</p>

<p>She nearly fainted at first; but, rousing herself, she
went to her trunk and looked carefully through that, then
her bureau drawers, thinking that perhaps she had removed
it to another place.</p>

<p>But neither the card nor the paper was to be found.</p>

<p>A wild suspicion came to her, and she rushed to Jewel's
room.</p>

<p>"Have you taken anything out of my desk?" she
asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Jewel looked around in surprise.</p>

<p>"What a question! Of course I have not taken anything
from your desk. Have you lost anything, or only
your senses, Flower Fielding?"</p>

<p>Flower shrunk sensitively from her sister's sharp voice
and angry glance, and answered in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I had a card with Laurie Meredith's name on it, and&mdash;a
very important paper. I thought perhaps you had
taken them away to tease me."</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen them. What was the paper
about?" Jewel asked, gazing sharply into her sister's
downcast face.</p>

<p>"I can not tell you, dear Jewel," was the sad reply.
Then taking courage in her misery, the poor girl continued.
"Do you remember where Laurie Meredith lived?
And will you tell me, for I have forgotten?"</p>

<p>"You wish to write to him?" sneered Jewel, and
Flower sighed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Has he written to you?"</p>

<p>"No; or at least I have never received a letter&mdash;but,
Jewel, he must have written&mdash;he must surely have written&mdash;only
I have never received the letter."</p>

<p>The piteous voice, the tearful blue eyes were very touching,
but Jewel Fielding laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know what I think?" she cried.
"You are a fool, Flower Fielding. The man never gave
you another thought after he left here, and I am surprised
at you for thinking of writing to him. And what would
mamma say? You know she forbid you to have anything
to say to Laurie Meredith."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Please do not tell her, Jewel, that I
wished to write to him," Flower faltered, anxiously.</p>

<p>"If you will promise me not to write to him, Flower, I
will not tell mamma."</p>

<p>"How can I write when I do not know where to address
a letter? But I will not promise, for if I find out I
shall write!" Flower cried, defiantly, and rushed away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel's beautiful dark face dilated with anger as she
muttered to herself:</p>

<p>"The obstinate little vixen, how I hate her! I do not
know why I do not tell mamma everything. It is only
because I am afraid she would not be severe enough upon
her. I will wait, wait, until I get more to go upon. That
wretched Sam, where can he have gone, and why does he
not return?"</p>

<p>For Sam had locked up the cabin on the morning after
Laurie Meredith disappeared, and had gone away, no one
knew where.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had gone to get rid of the importunities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Mrs. Fielding, fearing lest in some weak moment she
might cajole him out of the papers she desired so much.</p>

<p>However that may be, he had disappeared as entirely as
if mother earth had opened and swallowed him, and both
Mrs. Fielding and Jewel chafed bitterly over this misfortune.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding had gone to Sam's house several times in
the dead of night and made eager search for the papers,
but without success. But the known fact that Sam was
gone away, connected with the fact that lights had been
seen flaring through the cabin windows at night, speedily
gave room to gossips about the neighborhood to declare
that old Maria's ghost haunted the place.</p>

<p>When the report came to the ears of Mrs. Fielding she
smiled bitterly, and Jewel, who had been watching her
mother's face, immediately leaped to a conclusion. She
thought:</p>

<p>"She has been there searching for those papers at
night."</p>

<p>And she immediately determined that she would do the
same thing, for she felt convinced that her mother had
failed. Else why did she grow older and stranger with
such awful rapidity that her daughters shuddered sometimes,
fearing from her fits of rage alternating with fearful
moodiness that she was going mad.</p>

<p>Poor Flower, in spite of her own sorrows, felt an added
pang when she heard that the ghost of her old black nurse
was walking about her old home. She shed some bitter
tears, and ventured to express a timid fear lest Maria had
had something on her mind before she died which made
her spirit restless now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding scowled furiously and snarled angrily.</p>

<p>"Maria was a wicked old woman! She had done
enough evil to send her soul to torment, and I hope she is
suffering there!"</p>

<p>Her flashing eyes and vindictive words almost frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
her daughters, and Flower hurriedly retired to her
own room to weep bitterly over those unkind words spoken
of her dear old nurse.</p>

<p>Poor Flower, she was almost always weeping now! A
terrible trouble had come to her which she feared the
keen, cruel eyes of Jewel already suspected, although Mrs.
Fielding, absorbed in her bitter, secret musings, and
spending much of her time alone, noticed nothing.</p>

<p>The summer days were long since gone, and nearly six
months had passed since Laurie Meredith had to all appearance
deserted the trusting young girl whom he had
secretly made his wife.</p>

<p>To her grief and terror she had found out months ago
that a little child was coming to her, and she knew not
where to fly to hide the shame and disgrace hanging over
her golden head.</p>

<p>Oh, how she repented her folly and disobedience now,
for she believed that Laurie was false to her, and that he
had deliberately abandoned her after amusing himself with
her all the golden summer days!</p>

<p>She would rather have died than confess the truth to
her proud mother, now that the marriage-certificate was
lost, for she feared that her story would not be believed,
having an intuitive knowledge that Jewel would, through
the weight of her influence, be against her&mdash;Jewel, who
had taken no pains to conceal the fact that she had hated
her blue-eyed sister ever since that rivalry for Laurie
Meredith's love, in which Flower had been the winner.</p>

<p>So, as the cold days of winter deepened and darkened,
and the winds blew chill and cold across the stormy sea,
Flower began to stay in her room more and more, with
her pale face glued against the window-pane, thinking,
thinking, until she grew almost as wild-eyed as her mother,
and wondering how much longer it would be before she
would be compelled to fly to hide her disgrace.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>The time came when poor, unhappy Flower felt that
she could hide her condition no longer&mdash;not even from the
absorbed woman who took so little pride in her beautiful
daughters now.</p>

<p>For months she had been going about with a heavy
shawl wrapped about her; but the pretense of chilliness
could no longer avail her, for spring was in its second
month now and early flowers were in bloom.</p>

<p>She laid her plans tearfully to flee from home and leave
some of her things on the sea-shore, that her mother
might think she had drowned herself for love. Better
that than the bitter truth.</p>

<p>She had a little money&mdash;the savings of the little pin-money
allowed her monthly by her mother. She put this
in a little purse in her bosom, wrapped herself in a plain
dark cloak and thick veil, and started out, one dark twilight
hour, with a small hand-satchel on her arm, feeling
quite sure of escaping unmolested, as her mother was in
her own room, and Jewel had gone to the town close by to
do a little shopping, as she said.</p>

<p>Alas! Jewel was coming up the front steps, and a low,
malicious cry came from her lips as she sprung forward
and caught Flower rudely by the arm.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to&mdash;walk," Flower faltered, trying to draw herself
away; but Jewel held her fast.</p>

<p>"It is a falsehood&mdash;you are running away!" she exclaimed,
harshly.</p>

<p>"What does it matter if I <i>am</i> running away?" Flower
cried, growing desperate in her despair. "No one cares
for me now. Laurie has deserted me, mamma is changed
and cold, and you have grown to hate me so bitterly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
I feared to come and tell you of my trouble and beg you
to pity and help me. Let me go, Jewel, and throw myself
into the sea and end it all."</p>

<p>Jewel's eyes took on a baleful look in the twilight; she
muttered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"If I were quite sure you would do that I'd let you go;
but you wouldn't. You were running away to seek
Laurie Meredith, you know you were!"</p>

<p>"I have a right to seek him if I choose!" Flower cried,
roused to defiance by her sister's inhumanity. "He is my
husband, and no one knows it better than you, Jewel, for
I am quite sure that it was you who took the certificate
from my desk. Oh, sister&mdash;dear sister!" she cried, growing
suddenly wild and pathetic as she fell on her knees before
the hard-hearted girl, "you have tortured me long
enough, have you not? Even such jealous hate as yours
must be satisfied by the torments I have endured in the
past eight months. Oh, give me back my marriage-certificate!
Let me give it to my mother; perhaps then she
will forgive me, and I need not go away."</p>

<p>It was a thrilling picture, the lovely, wretched, forsaken
girl kneeling in the gloom of the shadowy porch, her fair
face upturned so pleadingly, the tresses of shining gold
falling in disorder over the dark cloak as she looked up at
that dark, proud face so transformed by jealousy and
anger that it appeared almost satanic, for no pity lightened
in the cruel, triumphant smile that parted the
curved, red lips.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! so you were married&mdash;a likely story!" she
hissed, scornfully. "And the poor little bride has lost
her marriage-certificate. That is unfortunate! But,
come, let us tell mamma. Perhaps she will forgive you,
anyhow."</p>

<p>With a wild, mocking laugh she dragged Flower to the
parlor, which Mrs. Fielding had just entered, and holding
her hapless sister tightly by the arm, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, I caught Flower running away from home,
and I brought her back."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding, startled out of her apathy at once, started
to her feet, crying wonderingly:</p>

<p>"Running away! Flower running away! But why?
What reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>Spite of Flower's frantic struggles Jewel tore the shrouding
cloak from her sister's form.</p>

<p>"Reason! ha, ha! Look at her one moment and you will
see her reason!" she laughed, in bitter triumph; and Mrs.
Fielding, after one wild, searching glance, threw up her
thin white hands and uttered a shriek of horror and anger
combined.</p>

<p>Jewel sprung quickly to her mother's side.</p>

<p>"Do not take it so hard, mamma," she cried, eagerly,
with blazing eyes. "Her disgrace can not touch you nor
me! Oh, mamma, I have fathomed the secret that has
tortured you so long! This is the girl that was foisted on
you by your faithless husband in place of my dead twin
sister! This Flower is Daisy Forrest's daughter!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a tragic moment in the lives of the three who
stood in that closed room looking into one another's faces
with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>Flower had fallen on her knees and dropped her shamed
face in her hands when Jewel tore away her cloak. But
at those startling words, uttered so triumphantly by her
twin sister, the little white hands fell helplessly at her
sides, and the blue eyes stared in bewilderment at her
mother.</p>

<p>Did she hear aright? Was she dreaming, or was that
Jewel, her twin sister, plucking eagerly at her mother's
sleeve and saying such strange things in that hard, triumphant
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't take it so hard, mamma. Her disgrace can
not touch you nor me. Ah, mamma, I have fathomed
the secret that has tortured you so long. This is the girl
that was foisted on you by your faithless husband in place
of my dead twin sister. This is Daisy Forrest's daughter."</p>

<p>The room seemed to reel, the solid walls to go up and
down in some strange fashion before Flower's dim eyes,
but she tried to keep her senses and hear what her mother
would say to this monstrous charge.</p>

<p>She saw the dark-eyed, white-haired woman reel backward
and throw up her arms into the air, while a strange,
unearthly cry burst from her lips&mdash;a cry that was half-fierce
joy and half a strangling horror.</p>

<p>Jewel laughed triumphantly, and continued:</p>

<p>"I was determined to find out Maria's secret&mdash;the terrible
secret that had changed you so, but you would not
satisfy my curiosity. So I watched and waited, and at
last I heard you talking to Sam about some papers that
he had hidden from you. I have been seeking them ever
since, and to-day I found them, read them, and so became
acquainted with all my father's villainy, and the share
taken in it by our old nurse."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fielding's eyes began to blaze with a wild, maniacal
light. She held out her hands with a commanding
gesture.</p>

<p>"The papers! Give them to me!" she cried, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Jewel shook her head.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said; "they are half burned anyhow. It
seems as if my father intended to burn them and never
let you know the deceit he had practiced on you. He
had written the whole story out, from time to time, in
his diary, and on the day he committed suicide he must
have flung it into the fire, and old Maria pulled it out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what she said. Give me the book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Jewel!" Mrs. Fielding cried, in wild impatience; but
again the clever, wicked girl refused.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she said; and suddenly turned on Flower,
pointing a scornful finger at her wan, white face. "Get
up; you look like a fool kneeling down there!" she exclaimed,
roughly. "Sit down there in that chair; mamma
is going to tell you who and what you are."</p>

<p>Flower dragged her trembling form up from the floor,
and obeyed, looking toward Mrs. Fielding with wistful,
frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, mamma!" Jewel cried, eagerly; but the
wretched woman uttered a low moan of distress and sunk
like a log to the floor.</p>

<p>Instinctively Flower rose to go to her assistance, but
Jewel pushed her back roughly into her chair.</p>

<p>"Do not you dare touch her!" she exclaimed, with
such a lightning-like glance that Flower fell abashed into
the chair.</p>

<p>Jewel knelt by her mother a minute; then rose, and
said:</p>

<p>"It is nothing but a faint; she will come to herself
presently. In the meantime, I will tell you the story of
my mother's ruined life, for which <i>your</i> mother is to
blame."</p>

<p>"My mother?" Flower echoed, bewilderedly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Jewel answered; and pointing at Mrs. Fielding,
she said: "That woman is no relation of yours; but
you are my half-sister&mdash;made so by the sin of our father."</p>

<p>A low, startled cry shrilled from Flower's white lips;
but Jewel did not heed it&mdash;only went on, like a young
fury:</p>

<p>"He was a villain, that Charley Fielding! Your mother,
who was beautiful, but poor and of obscure birth, he
betrayed; and my mother, who was rich, and his social
equal, he married for money, still keeping up his intrigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with the girl Daisy Forrest. So that you and I were born
within twenty-four hours of each other."</p>

<p>Flower sat bolt upright, listening with burning eyes and
a deathly pale face.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;your mother&mdash;died soon after your birth,"
Jewel went on, in a thick, excited voice. "My little twin
sister died, too, in a few hours after she came into the
world. Then old Maria, who lived until then with Daisy
Forrest, allowed her master to persuade her into a cruel
wrong. In short, my dead twin sister was buried upon
Daisy Forrest's breast, and you, her loving child, were
imposed upon my mother as her own&mdash;my mother, who
hated your mother with the bitterest hate, and who, if she
had dreamed of your identity, would have gone mad with
rage."</p>

<p>There was a slight movement of the still figure on the
floor. Mrs. Fielding was recovering.</p>

<p>Jewel went on:</p>

<p>"It was this secret that our old nurse revealed on her
death-bed to my mother. That one of the children she
claimed as her own was not hers, but she could not remember
which child&mdash;you or I&mdash;was Daisy Forrest's. She
told mamma that there were papers in her old chest that
she thought would prove the truth. Those papers Sam
hid, and to-day I searched the cabin and found them."</p>

<p>With a moan Mrs. Fielding lifted her head, but neither
of the two girls heeded her, so absorbed were they&mdash;Flower
in this terrible story, Jewel in gloating over her rival's
dismay.</p>

<p>"I read the papers&mdash;the torn leaves from his diary that
he flung into the fire and that Maria rescued," Jewel
added, with blazing eyes. "It set at rest the doubt that
has tormented my mother so long. It said that the child
with his own blue eyes and golden hair was the child of
Daisy Forrest, whose death drove him to suicide."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Fielding staggered to her feet. She stood looking
at Flower with a tortured face.</p>

<p>"Ah! even a mother's instinct has played me false in
this. I thought, I hoped&mdash;" she cried out, passionately,
then checked herself, and the agony of her face changed
to wrath and fury.</p>

<p>Advancing toward the shrinking, terrified girl, she exclaimed,
hoarsely, angrily:</p>

<p>"So I have wasted my love on you&mdash;you, my rival's
child! She had his heart and you his face&mdash;my false husband's
beautiful face! Are you not afraid that I will
strike you dead for having deceived me so bitterly!"</p>

<p>"I, mamma, I deceive you? Ah, no, no, for I did not
know!" Flower moaned, faintly, and shrinking in terror
from the wild-eyed woman towering over her so fiercely,
and who cried out, scornfully, now:</p>

<p>"No, that is true, you did not know what a heritage of
shame was yours, what a cloud hung over your birth&mdash;and
yet you proved yourself true to your inherited nature,
to your mother's false, light instincts. You rushed into
your sin, into shame&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Flower cried, indignantly, her face dyed red
with shame. She stood upright, and holding to the arms
of the chair to steady her trembling form, said, eagerly:
"I am Laurie Meredith's wife!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Jewel, with scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" echoed Mrs. Fielding, and there was a
sound in her voice that was terrible to hear&mdash;the tones of
incipient madness.</p>

<p>There was madness in her eyes, too, so horribly they
glittered as she sprung toward Flower, and all in an instant
buried her working white fingers in the girl's long
tresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daisy Forrest, I shall kill you!" she screamed, with
an awful, blood-curdling laugh; and dragging her victim
down upon her knees, she tried to clasp her fingers around
the fair white throat of her hated rival's child, and strangle
her life out.</p>

<p>In another moment murder would have been done, but
fortunately the monomaniac was thwarted in her deadly
purpose, for her maddened shriek had brought the servants
rushing to the scene, and Jewel, who had been silently
gloating over the terrible deed, realized that her plans
would be thwarted if this went further, and her crazed
mother murdered poor Flower for her unconscious transgression.</p>

<p>So with her own white, jeweled hands she assisted the
servants in their efforts to drag Mrs. Fielding away from
her victim, succeeding only just in time, for Flower was
discovered unconscious upon the floor, and some time
elapsed before she even breathed again, so terrible had
been the onslaught of her enemy.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fielding was for the time a raving mad woman.
She had to be bound and locked into a chamber
alone while the man-servant ran all the way to town to
bring a physician.</p>

<p>The remaining servants crowded around Jewel and
begged to hear what had been the cause of the strange
scene they had witnessed.</p>

<p>She explained satisfactorily to all, when she replied,
angrily:</p>

<p>"My sister had gone astray and disgraced us, and when
mamma found it out quite suddenly just now she went
mad with horror, and would have slain her if your timely
entrance had not prevented her rash deed."</p>

<p>Then she sent them all out, and sat down in the parlor
to watch Flower, who still lay on the floor breathing faintly,
but in such a weak and dazed condition that she realized
nothing of what had happened or of what was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
on around her, still less of the baleful black eyes that
watched her so malevolently, as Jewel said to herself:</p>

<p>"My mother is crazed, and the task of punishing this
hated girl has fallen from her hands to mine. Let me
think over all the most horrible things I have ever heard
of, and decide what I can do to make her suffer the
longest and worst in return for the torments I have borne
since she took my lover from me. Oh, I hate her as bitterly
as my mother hated her mother, and I swear I will
have vengeance for my wrongs!"</p>

<p>And those beautiful, evilly splendid black eyes, as they
floated over poor Flower's silent, unconscious form, looked
baleful enough for their very glances to kill.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Presently the house-maid put her head in at the
door, giving Jewel a violent start.</p>

<p>"Has the doctor come?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, miss; but me and the cook thinks we had better
carry Miss Flower upstairs and put her to bed," Tibbie
replied, with a compassionate look at the silent form upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Jewel frowned and considered a moment, then gave her
assent to the plan.</p>

<p>Then she added:</p>

<p>"When you come down, you had better lock the door,
as she might try to run away. In fact, she was about to
do so this evening, but mamma prevented her. Although
she has proved so bad, and disgraced the family, we intend
to keep her at home and take care of her."</p>

<p>The kind-hearted Tibbie murmured an approval of this
kindness, and with the cook's assistance, soon had Flower
undressed and placed in bed. Then seeing that she was
still in a dazed and half-unconscious condition, and either
unable or disinclined to speak, they shaded the lamp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
withdrew, locking the door as ordered, and giving the key
to the triumphant Jewel.</p>

<p>In the meantime the physician arrived and pronounced
Mrs. Fielding temporarily insane.</p>

<p>"I will leave soothing medicine for her, and I will send
two nurses from town, for she will have violent paroxysms,
and it will take at least two people to restrain her from
doing harm to herself or others," he said, and took leave,
wondering at the coolness and self-command of this beautiful
young girl, whose bright eyes were not dimmed by a
tear, as he explained to her the terrible condition of her
mother.</p>

<p>He would have been more surprised if he could have read
the thoughts of that vindictive heart.</p>

<p>"So she is really insane!" she said to herself. "I am
glad of that. There will be no one now to interfere with
my plans for Flower. It is true she would have killed
her if she had been let alone, but I do not want her to die
yet. I want her to live and wither under the shame of
her birth, and under the agony of her desertion by Laurie
Meredith. I will torment her as much as I can until the
child is born, then I hope she will die, and the brat, too,
so that when Laurie Meredith comes back I can have the
pleasure of telling him that they are dead, and showing
him their graves."</p>

<p>Her passionate, jealous love for handsome Laurie Meredith
was mixed with hate now, and she delighted in stabbing
his heart as he had stabbed hers when he turned from
her dark, dazzling charms to her sister's fair, angelic
beauty.</p>

<p>Going to her room, she unlocked her trunk and took out
some papers, over which she gloated with fierce delight.</p>

<p>"Although I long for power and gold, millions could
not buy these from me, for my sweet revenge is better
than gold! Ah, how cleverly I parted them! They outwitted
me when they managed to steal away and get married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
but I've kept them apart ever since, I've made
them pay dearly for their temerity!" she cried, exultantly.</p>

<p>The papers she held were the half-burned diary of
Charley Fielding, the marriage-certificate and card she
had stolen from Flower's desk, and the note she had intercepted
on its way to Flower, together with several letters
that Laurie Meredith had written to his wife since his
departure, and which, through Jewel's clever plotting,
she had failed to receive.</p>

<p>She pressed them in her hands, gloating over them with
more delight than a ball-room belle would have done over
the most priceless diamonds, for they represented the
power she thirsted for so ardently&mdash;the power to torment
those whom she hated.</p>

<p>She cared nothing for the fact, that in spite of all that
had come and gone, poor, unhappy Flower was her half-sister
still. She only knew that ever since the fatal hour
when Laurie Meredith had made choice between them she
had hated the blue-eyed, golden-haired beauty with a jealous
fury that was as pitiless as death.</p>

<p>She thought she was a very clever girl, she had managed
everything so adroitly. In the first place, she had
bribed Sam to give her Flower's letter that night, and to
take back a reply from herself. She had found out from
that letter that Flower was Laurie Meredith's wife, that
she was going away with him, and that a telegram had
called him away one day sooner, causing him to write to
Flower to come at once to him, as he must be far on his
way north before the next night, which was set as the time
for them to leave.</p>

<p>In that sudden emergency Jewel's keen wits served her
well. She remembered that her handwriting was so similar
to her sister's that few could tell them apart, so she decided
upon a bold step. She wrote to Laurie Meredith in
his wife's name, declaring that she had changed her mind
about going with him, that she could not bring herself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
leave her mother and sister, but that she would be his
true and faithful wife, and wait for him until he came
back from Germany.</p>

<p>The young husband was most bitterly disappointed, but
the telegram that summoned him to a parent's sick-bed
admitted of no delay. He went without Flower, but he
wrote to her very soon from his Northern home, entreating
her to reconsider her determination and join him there.</p>

<p>Jewel had a fervent admirer in the person of the post-office
clerk.</p>

<p>By cleverly playing on his vanity she induced him to let
her have Flower's letters, and each one she answered
briefly, by denying Laurie Meredith's wish and indulging
in weak regrets over the haste with which she had wedded
him, lamenting lest her mother should find out her folly
and withhold forgiveness.</p>

<p>So it was that not one of those loving letters, for which
Flower would have given her very life, ever reached her,
and Jewel sat here gloating over their possession, while in
the very next room poor little Flower lay upon her sleepless
bed, an image of despair, wondering if it could be true
all that Jewel had told her&mdash;that she was a child of shame,
her mother a bad, wicked woman, and her father a sinful
wretch who had broken the hearts of both her mother and
Jewel's.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>If any one had told Jewel Fielding that she had the
heart of a murderess, she would have indignantly denied
the accusation&mdash;she would have been frightened and angry
at the very idea&mdash;yet it was nothing less than a slow murder
that she began the next day.</p>

<p>In the first place, she gave out to the servants that
Flower was so ashamed and remorseful over her sin that
she wished to keep her own room all the time, and desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to see no human face save that of her sister; so, lest any
one should enter, she meant to keep her door locked all
the while. Jewel declared that she desired to humor her
sister's whim, and would carry her meals upstairs daily
with her own hands.</p>

<p>Having thus paved the way to carrying the key of
Flower's room in her pocket, and to starving her without
being found out, the vindictive girl went into Flower's
room, and surprised her at the task of plaiting a rope out
of her bed-clothes by which to escape through her window,
which was in the second story.</p>

<p>Jewel produced from under her dainty apron a hammer
and some nails, with which she proceeded to nail down
the window-sashes securely.</p>

<p>At first Flower tried to prevent her by holding back her
arm; but Jewel shook her loose with a fierce strength,
and, turning, menaced the white temple with the lifted
hammer.</p>

<p>"Dare to hold back my arm again, and I will kill
you!" she hissed, with vindictive rage, while the murderous
fire that flashed from her black eyes appalled Flower's
very soul.</p>

<p>With a moan she fell upon the bed, and lay watching
Jewel until she had finished securing the windows.</p>

<p>Then she rose up in bed, and brushing back the wealth
of sunny curls from her aching brow, began to plead
pathetically for her freedom.</p>

<p>"I wish to go away, and you have no right to forbid
me," she said at last, bitterly, resenting the scorn of the
other.</p>

<p>Jewel laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"No right!" she exclaimed. "Ha! ha! Then I will
take the right! You stole Laurie Meredith from me, and
now you are going to be punished for your treachery."</p>

<p>"Punished! As if I had not already suffered enough!"
the wretched girl cried, in pathetic despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going to suffer more yet," hissed Jewel, with
blazing eyes. "I am going to keep you locked up here,
and allow you nothing but bread and water, and not
enough of that. You shall wish yourself dead every day,
but there will be just enough bread to keep you alive in
misery&mdash;no more!"</p>

<p>Flower's beautiful face turned ghastly, her blue eyes
stared at the cruel girl with a dazed, horrified look.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jewel, I wish I were dead already! I have nothing
left to live for now!" she exclaimed. "But, still,
would it not be too horrible to starve me now? It&mdash;it
would be a double murder, for&mdash;for&mdash;oh, Jewel, did you
not forget the child?"</p>

<p>The piteous pleading for her unborn child only angered
Jewel the more, and with scornful, cutting phrases she
taunted her with her disgrace and misery, and reiterated
her intention of torturing her in return for what she called
her treachery.</p>

<p>When she left the room Flower believed that her fate
was sealed. Jewel had revealed her real self so plainly
that she could hope for no mercy and no pity.</p>

<p>She wept bitterly for the little unborn child, that
through Jewel's cruelty would have to die. She had
hoped somehow that she would find Laurie before it was
born, and that all would yet be well. For surely, surely,
he had not deserted her. It was only that some unfathomable
treachery on Jewel's part had kept them asunder.
She did not want to believe him false.</p>

<p>"But I must die, all the same, and he will never know
how I suffered through my love for him," she sighed, day
after day, as her strength waned under the scanty diet of
dry bread and stale water served to her daily by Jewel,
with cruel taunts and scornful looks for sauce.</p>

<p>She grew weaker and weaker, great hollows came into
her pale cheeks, her blue eyes looked larger than ever with
the purple shadows beneath them, while the one longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
cry of her heart was always for freedom, freedom, from
this dreadful house, through whose whole extent the
maniacal shrieks of the mad Mrs. Fielding echoed night
and day.</p>

<p>After weeks of this terrible life there came a day when
the horror-haunted house became unnaturally still and
quiet. Mrs. Fielding had been removed to an insane asylum,
and her wild cries no longer echoed on the shuddering
air.</p>

<p>Jewel knew that at the next meeting of the county
court a guardian must be appointed for herself and her
sister until her mother's recovery, and she resolved to
finish her awful work before any prying, perhaps suspicious
stranger should come into the house.</p>

<p>More than eight months had elapsed since Laurie Meredith
had gone away, and Jewel knew that the time of
Flower's trouble was near at hand.</p>

<p>She had been holding back one terrible thing for a <i>coup
d'tat</i> at the last, and she decided now that the fitting
moment had arrived in which to startle Flower into a
slightly premature illness and thus make sure of her death
at once.</p>

<p>It was a fiend's plan, a fiend's wish, but Jewel never
faltered in her deadly purpose. Her evil passions drove
her on to the commission of a deed that, call it by what
specious name she chose in her own mind, would be no
less than murder.</p>

<p>So she went into Flower's room one night carrying a
lighted lamp in one hand and a newspaper in the other.</p>

<p>In this long, weary month she had never permitted
Flower the use of a lamp at night, thinking that the long,
interminable hours of darkness would add to her torture,
as indeed they had done most effectually.</p>

<p>So the poor girl started up from her bed in alarm,
dazed by the brilliant light of the lamp, and filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
with a wild hope that Jewel was about to relent toward
her, she exclaimed, wildly:</p>

<p>"Ah, sister, you bring me a light. You begin to relent.
Blessings on you, dear Jewel! Now, give me food,
too, I am so hungry, so thirsty, and the air of this closed
room stifles me! Open the window and let the sweet air
of spring come in! Then bring me food, food, for I am
starving."</p>

<p>Jewel set down the lamp and took from her pocket a
beautiful, red-cheeked apple.</p>

<p>"I will give you just one bite of this if you will return
it to me when you have taken it," she said, with a mocking
laugh. And Flower promised; but when she had
taken as large a bite as her pearly teeth could compass,
her horrible hunger and thirst overcame her, and she
clung wildly to the luscious fruit, begging, pleading for
it, until Jewel forced it from her after a short, sharp
struggle, and restored it to her pocket.</p>

<p>"You are not half as hungry and thirsty for that delicious
fruit as I was hungry and thirsty for Laurie Meredith's
love!" she said, bitterly. "I loved him with my
whole heart, yet you took him from me, and now you
shall suffer for it! Ah, no, Madame Flower, I have
not relented! I am not going to give you any food,
nor water, nor fresh air; and if I brought a light it was
only that I might gloat over your agony when you read
something that I came upon accidentally this evening,
and which will add the last drop of bitterness to the overflowing
cup of your misery."</p>

<p>She laughed exultantly, and Flower shrunk back, with
her hand before her eyes to shut out the blaze of those
angry eyes that burned upon her face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had better not read it, then. I have borne all
that I can bear already," she moaned, faintly.</p>

<p>Jewel struck the wasted little white hand rudely away
from before Flower's eyes, and said, sharply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you would be glad to read this paragraph
about Laurie Meredith. It explains his seeming desertion
and falsity to you."</p>

<p>At these words a wild, strangling gasp came from
Flower's lips, and she caught eagerly at the paper, while
Jewel, with a plump, jeweled finger, pointed out a paragraph
marked heavily with black ink.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith's own hand had marked it, and he had
sent the paper to Flower many months ago, little dreaming
what a terrible purpose it was destined to serve.</p>

<p>It was a Boston newspaper, and the paragraph was simply
this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As we go to press we have just heard that our esteemed
townsman, Laurie Meredith, died very suddenly
last night."</p></blockquote>

<p>Jewel watched her victim eagerly, breathlessly.</p>

<p>She saw the hue of death overspread the lovely, wasted
face, the blue eyes, already dim through the tears that had
washed their brightness away, dilate in wonder and horror.
Oh, how sweet it was to see that look of mortal
agony on the face that Laurie Meredith had loved to kiss!
Jewel said to herself that in the months since he went
away, she had made her successful rival shed a thousand
tears for each and every kiss he had pressed on those
lovely, rosebud lips.</p>

<p>But her thirst for revenge was not sated yet. There
was yet another sweet draught waiting for her lips in the
near future.</p>

<p>All this time she had been keeping up the correspondence
with Laurie Meredith, in order to prevent him from
coming back South to see Flower. But she said to herself
that when the girl was dead she would cease writing. He
would become uneasy then, and the chances were that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
would soon come back. Then she, the girl he had
slighted, she would show him his wife's grave.</p>

<p>What sweetness there was in this thought for Jewel!
She gloated over it often, and thought that surely no girl
had ever had a more perfect revenge for slighted love than
she had taken.</p>

<p>Her thoughts went further yet sometimes.</p>

<p>She had taken the greatest pains to hide her enmity to
her sister. There was no one who could say she had been
unkind to Flower; Laurie Meredith should never know
otherwise, and from her reputed tenderness to his dead
wife, and her sweet sympathy with himself, should spring
up another flower of love that should bloom for her alone.
Some day she would be his wife, and the secret of all she
had done to part him from Flower should be buried forever
in the poor girl's grave.</p>

<p>She could see nothing to mar the success of her far-reaching
plans. With Flower dead, and her mother the
inmate of an insane asylum, she would be her own mistress,
with quite a handsome fortune at her command, and
she intended to make capital of her liberty and her position.</p>

<p>True, the physician had said that her mother's reason
would most probably return within a few months, but
Jewel had made up her mind that the foolish, half-mad
creature should never leave the asylum again. For so
young a girl she was wonderfully clever and headstrong,
and she was fully determined to have her own way.</p>

<p>With all these thoughts in her mind she stood watching
Flower reading those few brief lines, and she was not surprised
when with one low cry of anguish the unhappy girl
let the paper slip from her nerveless hands, and fell back
in a heavy swoon upon the pillow.</p>

<p>Jewel laughed as she looked at the still, white face, and
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"I will walk up and down the hall and get some fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
air while she recovers at her leisure," she said, aloud; and
she stepped outside and went to the hall window, which
was open, letting in a flood of balmy air, sweet with the
heavy scent of the early blooming lilacs.</p>

<p>She leaned her elbows on the window-ledge and looked
out at the beautiful tides of the sea rolling into the shore
with a hollow murmur, while the moon's bright rays
made silver paths across the restless waves. But Jewel
shivered, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But for him I should be dead, drowned in that cruel
sea! He saved my life, and I dedicated it to him. I
made him the king of my heart! Oh, why did she come
between us? If I am wicked it is all her fault. She drove
me mad."</p>

<p>Absorbed in her angry self-excuses, it was almost half
an hour before she returned to the room she had left, and
then she found Flower lying just as she had left her, cold
and apparently rigid, with no movement at her heart.</p>

<p>Jewel could not repress a low cry of horror. She was
only a girl, and wicked as she was, she was frightened
when she saw that life had fled from the body of her she
had so cruelly tortured.</p>

<p>She felt Flower's hands and they were deadly cold; she
shouted in her ear and she did not respond. Then running
into her own room, she brought out a pitcher of fresh
water, which she poured over Flower's head and face in a
perfect deluge.</p>

<p>But not a sigh, not the movement of an eyelash rewarded
her efforts at resuscitation. With something like
awe she began to realize that her work was completed
sooner than she had expected. Flower was already dead.</p>

<p>She flung wide the door and began to scream loudly for
the servants.</p>

<p>Her voice rang wildly down the long halls and dim stairways,
returning to her in ghostly echoes; but no one answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to her wild calls. The servants had stolen away
to a merry-making in the town.</p>

<p>Something of the truth began to dawn upon her mind
when she had shouted herself hoarse.</p>

<p>"They are either stolen away or fast asleep," she muttered,
and rushed down-stairs to their quarters in the
yard.</p>

<p>The cottage door was locked, and Jewel pounded lustily
without receiving any reply. Looking at the windows, she
saw that they were closed and dark.</p>

<p>"The wretches! how dared they go away and leave me
with that dead girl?" she muttered, ignoring the
fact that Flower had been alive a little while ago. The
deep, hoarse baying of the watch-dog, aroused in his distant
kennel by the noise she had made, caused her to start
and crouch down shivering on the back door-step.</p>

<p>"I shall stay here till they come. I&mdash;I&mdash;can not watch
by that dead girl alone!" she muttered, with a superstitious
horror of death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But in the meantime the copious shower of water she
had poured over Flower had taken effect.</p>

<p>While Jewel was battering at the door of the servants'
quarters Flower had revived and found the door wide
open, and such a draught of sweet, pure air rushing into
the room that it seemed to endow her with new life.</p>

<p>She dragged herself wearily into the hall and heard
Jewel's angry voice berating the servants down in the
yard. She instantly suspected the true state of the case.</p>

<p>"She thinks I am dead, and wishes to arouse the servants.
I must try to escape before she returns," she
moaned, faintly, and made her way down-stairs like a
spirit, slipped the bolt of the front door, and let herself
out, friendless and homeless, into the dark.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Nothing but her terrible fear of being recaptured and
imprisoned by her relentless foe could have given poor
Flower the strength to get away from the house that, after
being her home so long, had become a place "by horror
haunted."</p>

<p>But with a brave heart, although her footsteps faltered
often, she set off from the spot, traveling as fast as her
reduced strength would permit, and taking the high-road
that led away from the town and toward the deserted cabin
of the dead nurse.</p>

<p>It was instinct rather than intention that led her to the
place; for she had no thought of stopping there, but only
of putting miles of space between herself and Jewel, of
whom she had now become horribly afraid.</p>

<p>But, poor girl, starved as she had been, and in her delicate
condition of health, she had not strength enough to
carry her far. Besides, she had been tormented for several
days by peculiar pains, which now became so acute as
to materially interfere with her progress.</p>

<p>"I can not go any further. I must lie down here in
the road and die," she moaned, lifting her tear-wet eyes
to the moonlit sky, as if beseeching the pitying Lord to
have mercy on His suffering child.</p>

<p>In a minute more the white-paled fence and dark grove
of trees surrounding the cabin came into view.</p>

<p>The sight recalled old Maria to Flower's mind, and she
sighed plaintively:</p>

<p>"Ah, mammy, dear, I wish you were alive yet; then I
should have at least one friend in my misery."</p>

<p>She stopped and leaned on the old gate. All was dark
and silent, and the long branches of the trees threw fantastic
shadows on the ground that at any other time would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
have awed the sensitive girl; but she was oblivious now to
everything but her pain, her weariness, and her cruel
hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>"There is no one here. I will go into the house and lie
down on the pretty white company-bed that mammy always
kept so nice, and I will die there. Jewel will never think
of looking for me here. She knew that I was afraid of
ghosts," she murmured, as she unlatched the gate and
dragged herself up the graveled walk to the door.</p>

<p>She pulled the latch and found that it was not locked.
There was nothing to prevent her entering, so she groped
her way in, and, shivering and moaning, crossed the floor
to the tiny room which Maria had always kept sacred to
hospitality. She fell heavily across the little white bed,
and lay there thinking desolately that death could not be
far away.</p>

<p>Ah, how grateful the clean, soft feather bed felt to
Flower's weary, aching limbs! She thought that if only
those keen, sickening pains would cease she could fall
asleep and die thus, perhaps, in a pleasant stupor; but
the agony only grew greater, and a sudden realization of
truth forced a groan of fear from her lips.</p>

<p>Her travail was coming upon her, and the girl fainted
outright, and lay for some moments wrapped in a blissful
unconsciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night grew older, the moon rode high in the heavens,
and the stillness of the midnight hour was broken by
the shrill whistle of a steamer that touched at the wharf a
mile below, remained only long enough to throw out a
plank and permit the landing of two passengers and their
baggage, then went on its way majestically.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A newly married widower was bringing home a bride,
no less a personage than Sam, the good-looking mulatto
ne'er-do-well. As he had married from mercenary motives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the first time, his second match was for love alone,
and Maria's successor was a colored lady of as bright a
type as himself, young and sprightly, and good-looking.</p>

<p>She rejoiced in the patronymic of Pocahontas, which
was shortened by general consent of herself and friends to
"Poky."</p>

<p>Sam made arrangements for getting his bride's baggage
brought up in the morning, and tucking Poky's hand under
his arm, set forth to tramp the distance that lay between
the steamboat wharf and the humble cabin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girl who had lain in the darkness all night, racked
by cruel pains, and praying for death, gave a quick start
and held her breath in fear.</p>

<p>She heard loud voices and footsteps in the outer room,
and foreboded that Jewel had tracked her here.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! and I had thought to die alone and in
peace, undisturbed by her jealous, mocking eyes!" she
sighed to herself, despairingly.</p>

<p>She flung herself desperately out of the bed down upon
the floor, crawled under the white valance that hung all
around the old-fashioned bed, and lay there holding her
breath in terror, hoping that she would not be discovered.
One hope alone was left her&mdash;to die before those angry
eyes of her jealous half-sister shone upon her again.</p>

<p>In the meantime Sam had lighted a candle, and his wife
had helped herself to a chair, while she gazed around with
a critical eye at the appointments of the room.</p>

<p>It was well furnished indeed, for old Maria had been as
thrifty as Sam was shiftless, and Poky said presently that
"arter she had tidied up ter-morror it would be a very
decent sort of a place."</p>

<p>"So I told yer, my lub," replied Sam, affectionately,
and he gave the brown beauty an energetic kiss. Then
he said, persuasively, "Poky, 'sposen yer light a fire and
let us have a cup of coffee before we go to bed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Poky assented good-naturedly, and very soon a fire was
crackling in the little kitchen stove, and the odor of coffee
and broiling ham pervaded the air. Then Poky took from
the capacious basket she had brought on her arm a loaf of
bread and a roll of butter, and proceeded to set the little
table for her lord's repast.</p>

<p>It was just as she had finished her thrifty preparations,
and invited Sam to "draw up his cheer," that he gave a
startled little cry, and looked over his shoulder apprehensively:</p>

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>"Poky!"</p>

<p>"What's de matter, nigger, lookin' over yo' shoulder
like you see sumfin'? Don't yer go 'magining now dat
ole 'oman is ha'ntin' de house!"</p>

<p>He came closer to his wife and whispered, tremulously:</p>

<p>"Hush, honey; Maria did say as how if de dead could
come back she would, and&mdash;and&mdash;I heard somefin' sartain&mdash;oh,
Lord!"</p>

<p>He gave a jump, and so did Poky. Both had heard
something this time&mdash;the low wails of a new-born infant
proceeding from the next room.</p>

<p>They held their breath for a minute, then Poky, who
was rather strong-minded, said, contemptuously:</p>

<p>"Cats!"</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do&mdash;you think so, Poky?" her better half inquired,
dropping his trembling frame into a chair, and
more than half convinced that Maria was haunting him
already.</p>

<p>"Sartain!" said Poky, with a sniff. "Lors, Sam, what
a coward you be! It's only some cats as is got in thrue a
open window."</p>

<p>She seized a poker and the candle and disappeared into
the "company room," leaving Sam cowering in the dark,
and trembling lest the shade of his departed Maria should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
pounce upon him at any minute and shake him for having
presumed to give her a successor.</p>

<p>Then a succession of low wails echoed on the air again,
and Sam shook himself together with returning courage.</p>

<p>"'Twas cats after all! I thought so!" he ejaculated,
with a feeble chuckle. "And, Lordy, but Poky's
a-makin' 'em git!"</p>

<p>Apparently it took her some time to disperse the feline
intruders, for fifteen minutes elapsed, and she did not return.
Then he attempted to follow her and got the door
slammed in his face with the curt yet good-naturedly delivered
sentence:</p>

<p>"You stay whar you is, nigger!"</p>

<p>He slunk back to his chair, and presently she came out
with an important face, and lighting another candle,
placed it on the table, and told him to eat his supper.</p>

<p>"But, Poky&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all right, Sam. 'Twasn't no cats, nor no
ghosts, only a beautiful young gal, Sam, runned away
from her friends to-night and hid herself here for her chile
to be borned, which it was dat baby we heerd a-caterwauling."</p>

<p>"Who is she, Poky?" amazedly.</p>

<p>"She said you'd know&mdash;some sort o' name like Flower
o' de fiel', or somethin'. But I mus' go back and tend
to her and dat baby. Lucky for her we cum here dis
night. Eat your supper without me, Sam, 'cause I'se
needed bad in dere."</p>

<p>She disappeared again, and Sam sat there conscience-stricken,
wondering if his sin that night months ago had
brought this thing to pass.</p>

<p>He had known that Laurie Meredith and Flower Fielding
were lovers, and he had guessed that Jewel was jealous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
when she bribed him so heavily to give her that important
letter and to take back the answer she sent. In
his eagerness to possess himself of her costly bribe he had
not counted the cost of his treachery to the lovers. Now
he began to experience a sneaking consciousness that his
guilt had somehow helped to pave the way to that trouble
in yonder.</p>

<p>He wondered what had become of Laurie Meredith, that
his pretty sweetheart had been forced to seek refuge in a
deserted negro cabin in her sore distress and trouble, and
so wondering, he fell asleep in his chair, and remained
there until morning, snoring profoundly, and oblivious to
everything.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he opened his eyes again the broad sunlight of
new day was shining in through the open door, and
the song of birds was in the air.</p>

<p>Poky's trunk had come up, and she was down on her
knees unpacking it, and softly humming a revival song.</p>

<p>Sam's neck, which had been hanging over on his breast,
felt as if it was half broken. He straightened up and
gaped so loudly that his wife turned around and began to
rate him soundly for sleeping in his chair all night, declaring
that she had nearly shaken him to pieces without
being able to rouse him, so had retired, leaving him to the
enjoyment of his arm-chair.</p>

<p>Sam did not doubt the assertion, knowing himself to be
a very heavy sleeper. He sat still a little while collecting
his wits, and then said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it all now, Poky. I fell to sleep
while you was in de comp'ny with Miss Flower an'
de baby."</p>

<p>"Wha-at?" Poky exclaimed, and he repeated his
words, only to be laughed at by his wife, who declared
that he must have been dreaming, as she did not know
what he meant in the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>In vain did Sam go over the startling events of last
night to his laughing wife. She admitted the cats in the
company room, but the rest of the story she laughed to
scorn.</p>

<p>"You fell asleep, you foolish nigger, while I was scatterin'
dem tom-cats off dat shed, and you dreamed all de
rest," she said; and to satisfy his doubts she made him go
into the spare room, which he found neat and tidy, as in
Maria's time, the white bed smooth and unrumpled, the
two cane-seated chairs standing rigidly against the wall,
the small looking-glass on the white-draped toilet-table
reflecting his crest-fallen face only, as Poky, standing at
the open door, said, jibingly:</p>

<p>"I hope you'se satisfied now! You don't see any babies
nor flowers in dere, does you?"</p>

<p>The puzzled dreamer shuffled out with rather a sheepish
air, and while he did justice to his morning repast, had to
endure a running fire of commentaries on his dream that
drove him at last quite out of the house, to escape being
the butt of Poky's merry malice.</p>

<p>Presently, while he was sulkily smoking his pipe in the
front yard, she came out to him in her check apron, with
her sleeves rolled up, and carrying the broom in her
brown, shapely hand. With rather a sober air, she said:</p>

<p>"I declare, Sam, I was so tickled at yer foolish dream
that I forgot to tell yer what the man said as brought my
trunk this mornin'."</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired her sulky spouse.</p>

<p>"Why, it 'pears like a young lady 'bout dis neighborhood
drowndid herself las' night."</p>

<p>"Sho!" exclaimed Sam, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, siree&mdash;drowndid herself on account of trubble
an' sickness. What made it all de worse was dat she was
de beautifulest gal in de country, and had a twin sister
ekally beautiful, and dat pore thing is 'most crazy 'bout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
it all," explained Poky, while Sam eagerly demanded
names.</p>

<p>"Sho! I has such a pore mem'ry fer names," Poky
began, reflectively; then she stuttered: "Ju&mdash;Ju&mdash;Jule&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jewel and Flower!" shouted Sam, and her eyes
beamed with delight.</p>

<p>"Dat's dem! and 'twas de las' one&mdash;dat Flower&mdash;dat
got up outen her sick-bed and runned away las' night, and
Jule she said shorely she done drowndid herself, 'cause
how she done said she would do it de first chance, and she
was so weak she couldn't a' walked no furder than down
to de sea-shore."</p>

<p>"Golly! I mus' go up to de big house and hear 'bout
it," Sam exclaimed, darting toward the gate, while Poky
called after him, jibingly:</p>

<p>"Sam, don't go and tell anybody 'bout yer foolish
dreams las' night."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>In the golden days of June, more than three months
after the occurrences of our last chapter, Laurie Meredith
returned to the scene of his love affair, and made his way
to the large stone house where the Fieldings had lived last
summer.</p>

<p>He had not had a letter from Flower for the last two
months, and this had brought him to seek her earlier than
he otherwise would have done, for while he had received
her letters he had known that she was well and contented,
but her silence filled him with such fear and discontent
that he left Germany, determined to have it out with the
Fieldings and take his bride away.</p>

<p>No rumor of the changes that had taken place since his
departure had reached him. He knew not that Mrs.
Fielding was the inmate of a lunatic asylum, and Flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
reported dead. His heart was full of eager joy as he ran
up the steps of the old stone house, expecting in a very
short time to clasp Flower to his yearning heart, and tell
her that she must leave her mother and sister and come
with him now, for he could never be parted from her
again.</p>

<p>The parlor window was open, and the notes of the
piano, accompanied by a sweet voice, became audible as
he stepped upon the porch. He stopped a minute to
hear, thinking that the musical voice belonged to Flower.
Then he shivered. The voice and the words were so sad
that they struck a chill to his heart.</p>

<p>It was only an old song, heard many a time before, but
its plaintive sadness had never struck him as forcibly as
now, when it came sighing through the lace curtains, and
mingling with the summer breezes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Weary of living, so weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Longing to lie down and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To find for the sad heart and dreary<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The end of the pilgrimage nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Weary, so weary of wishing<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For a form that has gone from my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a voice that is hushed to me ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For eyes that to me were so bright!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Weary, so weary of waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Waiting for sympathy sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For something to love and to love me,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The pleasures that are not so fleet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a hand to be held on my forehead,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A glimpse of the golden-brown hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a step that to me was sweet music,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And a brow that was noble and fair!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Laurie Meredith's heart thrilled in sympathy with the
singer. It was Flower, of course. She was thinking of
him, the sweet darling, he knew. Oh, how glad she
would be to see him again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened the front door without ceremony, and entered
the hall, reckless of the risk he ran of meeting Mrs.
Fielding and encountering her angry reproaches. He
would stop for nothing now, so anxious was he to clasp
that sweet singer to his heart, and tell her she should
never be "weary of waiting" again, never be parted from
him more.</p>

<p>But the wide hall was silent and deserted. Very softly
he opened the parlor door and stepped across the threshold.
Then he saw that the girl at the piano was the only
occupant of the room.</p>

<p>She turned around quickly, and he saw dark eyes instead
of blue ones, dark locks instead of golden curls.
Jewel sprung up with a thrilling cry:</p>

<p>"At last!"</p>

<p>There was unmistakable love and joy in her face and
voice. She made no effort to conceal her glad surprise.
Had she not been waiting for this hour for months, had
she not dressed for him daily, determined that whenever
he came he should find her at her best? And now, conscious
of her pretty, rose-tinted mull, that was so becoming
to her dusky beauty, she rejoiced that her efforts were
crowned with success. Her beauty could not fail to make
a strong impression.</p>

<p>But he started back in surprise and disappointment,
and forgetting even the conventional greeting he owed
her, exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Where is Flower?"</p>

<p>"Flower?" cried Jewel, sharply, with a clouded brow.
"Oh, Mr. Meredith, did you not know? Poor Flower is
dead!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel had not meant to break the truth so suddenly to
Laurie Meredith, but his cruel indifference to herself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
his anxiety over Flower, piqued her into retorting upon
him so suddenly. She had her revenge, for, after gazing
at her blankly for one agonized moment, the young man
threw up his arms, staggered wildly, then fell like a log
at her feet.</p>

<p>The terrible revulsion of feeling from love, hope, and
expectancy to despair had almost slain him, and he lay for
several minutes quite unconscious, while Jewel knelt beside
him in an agony of fear.</p>

<p>"He is dead, and all my schemes have been in vain,"
she thought, wildly; and in her despair she kissed the
cold, white face, and laid her dark head on the pulseless
breast of the man she loved so wildly, and wished that she
too were dead and cold.</p>

<p>Presently she lifted her head and laid her cheek against
his, whispering, reproachfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, if you had given your heart to me instead
of her, all this would not have happened. We
should have been as happy as the day is long."</p>

<p>A step in the hall startled her, and she sprung up just
as the door opened, and her companion, an elderly widow
lady, entered the parlor.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Wellings!" exclaimed Jewel, wildly, and
the lady screamed as she saw the apparently dead man on
the floor.</p>

<p>As soon as she could speak she began to question Jewel
volubly, and the girl explained that he was a friend of
hers, and had dropped like that on entering the room.</p>

<p>A physician was hastily summoned, and it was found
that Laurie Meredith was not dead. He soon revived,
but he had received such a shock that weeks of illness followed,
and Jewel declared that he must not be moved
from the house.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room. The doctor could send an
experienced nurse, she said, and she and Mrs. Wellings
would do all they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>So it followed, that when Laurie Meredith first opened
his eyes, after weeks of delirium, with a conscious gaze
they fell on Jewel sitting by his bed, looking exquisitely
charming in a long white tea-gown with crimson silk facings,
and some crimson rosebuds in her braided hair.</p>

<p>He looked at her bewilderedly at first, then a memory
of the past began to dawn on him, and he asked her if he
had been sick.</p>

<p>"Yes, with brain-fever, for nearly three weeks, but you
are better now," Jewel replied, in a sweet, gentle voice
that thrilled him in spite of himself, for it sounded something
like Flower's as it had whispered to him of her love
last summer. He closed his eyes a few moments, and
when he opened them again he remembered all.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! I remember all now," he moaned,
"You told me that my darling was dead."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in a soft, sweet tone, "Flower is dead&mdash;poor,
unfortunate girl&mdash;but I would not have broken it
to you so abruptly if I had known that you would take it
so hard."</p>

<p>"You knew I loved her, Jewel," he said, looking keenly
into the beautiful, sparkling face.</p>

<p>"Yes, once," she replied; "but I thought it had all
blown over long ago. Mamma refused her consent, and
then you went away. I thought you had forgotten it, as
Flower did very soon."</p>

<p>"No, no, she did not forget, Jewel!" he groaned; then
paused, remembering that Jewel could not be expected to
know anything of that secret marriage and their correspondence.
Presently he said, mournfully:</p>

<p>"She is dead&mdash;beautiful Flower is dead! How long
ago was it, Jewel?"</p>

<p>She named the day when Flower had run away, and
added:</p>

<p>"She committed suicide. She drowned herself in the
sea."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>She feared he would faint again, so awful was the pallor
that overspread his face, so she cried out, hastily:</p>

<p>"But it was not her love for you that drove her to despair,
but her shame and grief at finding out the secret of
her parentage."</p>

<p>And she went on to tell him of the secret old Maria had
revealed on her death-bed, and which had driven her
mother mad at last, and caused Flower to drown herself.</p>

<p>"Mamma did not tell her for a long time, and when
Flower heard it at last she went almost as mad as poor
mamma, and vowed she would drown herself. Oh, Mr.
Meredith, you can not think how dreadful it all was!" sobbed
Jewel, desolately.</p>

<p>He made no comment. He could not speak after the
dreadful story she had been telling him. He only lay and
listened in dumb horror.</p>

<p>Jewel recovered herself, and continued:</p>

<p>"There was mamma, raving mad, and at last they had
to take her to the asylum. As for Flower, she fell ill,
and tried again and again to take her own life. I had to
watch her always to prevent her going to the sea and
throwing herself in. You see, Mr. Meredith, she was my
half-sister, and I could not help but love her in spite of
her birth and of our father's sin. So I did not tell any
one our dreadful secret, I only loved poor Flower the
more, and in her sickness I tended her carefully until that
awful night when I thought her dead, and rushed down-stairs
to call for help. Then she revived, got out of the
house, and drowned herself."</p>

<p>"Her body&mdash;was it ever recovered?" he asked, and
Jewel replied:</p>

<p>"No; but we are certain she drowned herself, because
some of her garments were found on the sea-shore."</p>

<p>"It is terrible!" he groaned, and looking keenly at
her pale face, he asked: "Did Flower leave any papers,
any letters, Jewel, that told you anything strange?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she answered, unblushingly; and he reflected
that it would be no use to tell her that Flower had been
his wife. She was dead, poor little darling; but he
thanked Heaven that the misery that had driven her to
suicide was at least none of his making.</p>

<p>"But, ah, if she had only come with me she would
probably never have heard the shameful secret of her
birth," he thought; and it seemed to him now that he understood
Mrs. Fielding's object in refusing to let her
daughters marry any one.</p>

<p>"She was very honorable. She was not willing that
Flower's story should be known, yet she could not give
her to any one who was ignorant of it," he thought, feeling
an accession of pity and respect for the woman who
had been so deeply wronged, yet who had remained so
honest and conscientious.</p>

<p>Presently Jewel murmured something about nourishment,
and glided lightly from the room. He closed his
eyes and lay thinking of the strange story she had told
him, and of his poor, blighted little Flower, who had gone
to her death rather than endure the bitter shame that had
come to her with the knowledge of her birth. The deep
regret that she had not gone away with him last summer
pierced his heart so bitterly that fever set in again, and he
had a relapse that came near costing him his life.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>When Laurie Meredith was well enough to go away
again, the summer was more than half gone, and he felt
that he owed a debt of gratitude to Jewel Fielding for her
hospitality and friendliness that he knew not how to pay,
since she refused money, and there was nothing else that
he could give.</p>

<p>The situation was most embarrassing, for in spite of his
sorrow, sickness, and preoccupation, he could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
seeing that Jewel took more than a friendly interest in
himself.</p>

<p>It was this that decided him to go away at once, that he
might give no encouragement to her fancy. He said to
himself that his heart was dead, that he could never reciprocate
her love, so he would go away, and she was so
young and gay she would soon forget him.</p>

<p>"If there is anything I can do for you at any time,
Jewel, remember that I desire you to command my services,"
he said to her, when he broke to her, as gently as
he could, the news that he was going away the next day.</p>

<p>She had borne it more calmly than he had expected.
The bright cheeks grew pale, and the lashes drooped to
hide the sadness in the dark eyes, but she said, eagerly:</p>

<p>"There is something you can do for me&mdash;now. I have
a favor to ask of you."</p>

<p>"You have only to name it," he replied, gallantly; and
she began to tell him that she was tired of her life in this
quiet seaport town of Virginia.</p>

<p>She was rich, and she longed to live in the city and mix
with its gayeties, that she might forget the sorrows she
had borne here.</p>

<p>"You live in Boston; you have a mother and sister,"
she said. "Would it be wrong for me to come to Boston
to live? Would it be too much to ask your family to
present me in society?"</p>

<p>He was surprised and secretly annoyed. He saw her
drift in a moment. She did not mean to lose sight of
him. Her love was stronger than he had thought.</p>

<p>He did not answer her for a moment, from sheer surprise,
and she continued:</p>

<p>"I have a most excellent lady for a companion, as you
know. I should like to buy a handsome house in your
city, and set up housekeeping with Mrs. Wellings as my
chaperon and companion. There would be nothing imprudent
in that, I suppose?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>He was obliged to own that, as far as he knew, such a
proceeding would be quite proper.</p>

<p>"Then it is settled!" she cried, joyfully. "Now, will
you be so kind, when you get home, as to see a real estate
man and buy a handsome house for me? I shall like it
all the better if it is near your home, for I know I shall be
fond of your mother and sisters&mdash;that is, if they are all
like you."</p>

<p>He could not help coloring at the frankly spoken words,
and he cried out, hastily:</p>

<p>"But, my dear Miss Fielding, I fear I should not be
able to please you in the selection of a house. It would
be much better for your guardian to attend to that matter."</p>

<p>"He is an old stupid; I would not trust him in the
selection of such a house as I want," she replied, vivaciously;
and, after thinking a moment, he said:</p>

<p>"Then you should select it yourself. What would you
say to coming to Boston this autumn as the guest of my
mother?"</p>

<p>"I should be charmed!" Jewel declared, graciously.</p>

<p>"Then my mother shall send you an invitation, and
then you can select a house yourself," he said, adding,
with a slight smile: "I predict that you will be a belle
when you enter society."</p>

<p>"What! a little country girl like me?" cried Jewel,
with sparkling eyes; and he saw that she was delighted at
the compliment, and told himself that this was the very best
thing he could have thought of&mdash;inviting her to his home.
In society she would see so many handsome men she would
get over her penchant for him.</p>

<p>"And I am going abroad again, anyway. I could not
bear a quiet life now. I must seek oblivion in strange
scenes and a new life," he thought, sighing, as he left her
and went out into the grounds, where everything reminded
him so vividly of his little, lost love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! she was gone now from those scenes that her fairy
form had brightened, and the low murmur of the sea, as
it rolled with a sullen murmur in to the shore, tortured
him with the thought that it held her in its cruel embrace.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For the heart of the waters is cruel,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And the kisses are dire of their lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And their waves are as fire is to fuel<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To the strength of the sea-faring ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though the sea's eye gleam as a jewel<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To the sun's eye back as he dips."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Who would have dreamed," he thought, "last summer,
that such a tragedy would have overtaken this little
family? The mother insane, one daughter dead, the other
restless and unhappy because of an unhappy love! Poor
Jewel! she is indeed bereaved!" he thought, as he walked
down a graveled path toward the rear of the house, to get
away from the sorrowful sound of the ever-restless sea.</p>

<p>And as his walk took him quite near the servants' quarters,
he suddenly came face to face with old Maria's relict,
Sam, whom he had never seen since that night last summer
when he had sent him to carry that letter to Flower.</p>

<p>At first the mulatto looked sheepish and inclined to retreat;
but, seeing Laurie's hand go into his pocket, he
turned back, and was presented with a bright silver dollar,
for which he returned profuse thanks.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sam, no more letters to carry now. She is dead,
poor Flower!" sighed the young man, sorrowfully, and
the mulatto gave him a strange glance, and replied, resentfully:</p>

<p>"Yes, she's dead, and it's your fault, too, Mr. Meredith!
What made you sneak off and leave poor Maria's
nuss child to bear her shame and disgrace by herself?"</p>

<p>"Shame and disgrace!" the young man repeated, bewilderedly,
and Sam looked around, and seeing no one
near, whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess no one hain't told you about my dream, has
they, now?"</p>

<p>"No," Laurie answered, wondering if Sam were drunk
or crazy, yet submitting to be drawn aside into a convenient
arbor, where the story of Sam's return with his bride
that fateful night was quickly told.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith's pale face grew whiter and more haggard
still, and Sam, seeing it, added, quickly: "But
'twan't nuthin' but a dream, sir, or a warnin' o' her
death, for she were dead and drowndid then, pore gal!"</p>

<p>"But, Sam, there could have been nothing like that&mdash;a
child, I mean&mdash;Flower would have written to me!" he
exclaimed, incoherently.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, Mr. Meredith, there was a child
comin'&mdash;hain't Miss Jewel told you?" cried Sam, and a
terrible groan answered him:</p>

<p>"My wife, my little wife, oh, why did you not tell
me!" and then he rushed wildly to Jewel, demanding to
know why she had kept this from him.</p>

<p>"My sister's disgrace&mdash;oh, how could I tell you, who
loved her, of that dark stain?" she began; but he interrupted,
wildly:</p>

<p>"There was no stain, no disgrace; she was my wife by
a secret marriage, and she promised to go away with me
but she was afraid of her mother, and stayed. Jewel, this
story must be published to the world, that no stain may
rest on her memory," he declared, passionately to the
cruel girl who had brought about all this misery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel bit her lips in anger and scorn when she learned
that Laurie Meredith had found out the secret she had
guarded so carefully, fearing lest he should love the memory
of the dead girl better for that knowledge.</p>

<p>But she dared not give vent to her chagrin in his presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
She knew that she must dissemble, must keep up
her deceitful rle, and agree to his declaration that the
fact of his marriage to Flower should be made public.</p>

<p>So she soothed him with gentle words of sympathy, and
pretended to be overjoyed at hearing that Flower had been
a wife, and not the guilty girl she had been believed to be.</p>

<p>She declared herself eager to convince every one that
Flower had been his wife.</p>

<p>"You will give me the marriage-certificate, of course,
and I will show it to the townspeople," she said.</p>

<p>He explained to her that he had left the certificate with
his young wife.</p>

<p>"You will probably find it among her papers," he said,
confidently; but search for it proved the contrary.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" she asked him, with pretended
anxiety.</p>

<p>He looked puzzled for a moment, then his face cleared.</p>

<p>"Although the certificate can not be found I can prove
the marriage by the minister who performed the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jewel; but when he said that it was the
Reverend Mr. Archer, of little Episcopal Chapel, she
shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to tell you, but he has gone abroad.
His health was failing, and his congregation sent him to
Europe for a year," she replied.</p>

<p>He looked dismayed for a moment, then rallying, said,
confidently:</p>

<p>"They will certainly take my word, when I declare
that I was Flower's husband."</p>

<p>Jewel looked very dubious. She would not answer.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he demanded, impatiently, and
Jewel sighed, and answered:</p>

<p>"People are so hard and malicious&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am afraid
they would not listen without proof."</p>

<p>He knew that this was quite true. The world was so
hard, especially where a woman's honor was concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
that it would not hear the vindication of an angel without
proof.</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously he groaned aloud:</p>

<p>"What am I to do? How vindicate the memory of my
lost angel in the minds of those who believed her false and
light?"</p>

<p>Much as she loved him, Jewel gloated over his suffering.
She would not have spared him one pang if by lifting
her hand she could have thrown off the whole burden
of his misery.</p>

<p>"He preferred her to me! Let him bear the punishment
I have meted out to him!" she thought, triumphantly;
and presently she said:</p>

<p>"There seems only one way out of our difficulty. We
can not speak until the Reverend Mr. Archer comes back
to verify your story."</p>

<p>"That is hard&mdash;to wait a year&mdash;a whole year&mdash;ere I
vindicate my darling's memory," he groaned. But Jewel
remained silent, knowing that in the end he would be
obliged to agree with her declaration.</p>

<p>He did so, and the next day he left Virginia and journeyed
to the watering-place where his mother and sisters
were spending the summer quietly on account of the
recent death of the head of the house.</p>

<p>He did not tell them the pathetic story of his secret
marriage, and his young wife's death. They would hear
it all from Jewel soon enough, he thought, shrinking
from all the questions they asked him about his altered
looks, and finding it hard to ask for the invitation Miss
Fielding desired so much.</p>

<p>But he did it at last, in spite of their haughty surprise;
and, after they had heard that he had been ill for weeks in
the house of the beautiful heiress, that she had tended
him with all the affection of a sister, and that she was
lonely and orphaned, they began to feel that they owed
Jewel a debt that would be but poorly canceled by all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
they could do. So the invitation was written and sent,
eagerly accepted, and Jewel at once began to get ready
for her winter campaign, as she called it to herself, feeling
that victory already perched upon her banner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Two years went by on the swift wing of time, and Miss
Fielding had drained to its dregs the full cup of success,
in which there was but one drop of bitter, the torturing
fact that Laurie Meredith still remained abroad, oblivious
to her charms.</p>

<p>He had gone away before she went to Boston, and so he
had not seen her brilliant social triumph, for her dusky
Southern beauty had carried society by storm, and Mrs.
Meredith had been quite proud of her protge.</p>

<p>Now Jewel had an elegant home on the same street with
the Meredith mansion, and Mrs. Wellings, as her companion
and chaperon, was mistress of a home where the
most elegant entertainments were given, and where life
was always at its gayest, for the beautiful heiress loved to
surround herself with light-hearted people, and to live
always in the midst of pleasure, perhaps that she might
keep at bay the pangs of remorse that must sometimes
have pierced her heart if she had given herself time to
think of those whose lives she had ruined.</p>

<p>Winter was coming on again, and at last Laurie Meredith
was coming home. He could not hold out longer
against the prayers of his mother and sisters, so he had
promised to return from that long exile, in which he had
been a restless, unhappy wanderer, seeking:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from his memories of Lenore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jewel contrived to make one of the home party when
he arrived, and he could not help but see into what a
magnificent-looking woman she had grown since he went
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The rich, trailing robe of ruby velvet, trimmed with
gray fur, was very becoming to her stately style, and her
eyes were bright with welcome as he clasped her beautiful
hand.</p>

<p>Lovers by the score she had had since she came to Boston,
but none had erased from her passionate heart the image
of handsome Laurie Meredith, for whose sake she had
sinned so deeply and recklessly, and now she felt that her
long waiting was about to be rewarded.</p>

<p>He had had time to forget Flower, and surely he could
not longer remain cold to her love and her charms.</p>

<p>It gave him a pang to see her, for she always recalled
Flower to his mind, and the thought of his lost love was
always painful.</p>

<p>But he chided himself for his reluctance at meeting her,
and perhaps his welcome was doubly cordial on that account;
and his family, seeing it, made up their minds
that the pair were fond of each other in a tenderer fashion
than they had suspected.</p>

<p>Perhaps they hinted something of the sort to him, for
the first time he found himself alone with her, he said to
her:</p>

<p>"Miss Fielding, is it possible that you have never told
my mother and sisters of my marriage?"</p>

<p>Jewel looked up at him with her radiant eyes, and answered:</p>

<p>"You might have known that I would not betray your
secret."</p>

<p>He was nettled by her use of that word. It seemed like
a tacit reproach to him, and while he paused for words in
which to reply, she added:</p>

<p>"Of course I knew that if you had desired them to
know you would have confided in them before you went
away. So I respected your desire, and not a word of it
has passed my lips."</p>

<p>"You misunderstood me," he rejoined, eagerly. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
meant them to know&mdash;only I was weak and sick still when
I went away, and it was so painful to reopen that cruel
wound. I fully expected they would hear all from you."
She was silent, twisting her ringed fingers slowly in and
out, and Laurie Meredith continued: "I wish that you
had spoken, for now the duty falls on me. I feel like a
wretch and a coward, keeping this secret from my nearest
and dearest."</p>

<p>Jewel's dark eyes sought his face with such a strange
look that he said, involuntarily:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>She answered, deliberately:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that the silence you have kept so long
ought to be preserved still. What good would come of
speaking now?"</p>

<p>"They ought to know," he said, uneasily.</p>

<p>"But why, Mr. Meredith? You would only distress
them if you told your story now. They have heard from
me my mother's story and Flower's. They know that she
drowned herself because of the dishonor of her birth. Do
you think, proud as they are, that they would be pleased
to know that the daughter of poor, erring Daisy Forrest
had been your wife?"</p>

<p>His face flushed deeply, then his brown eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"It was cruel of you to tell them that. Why need you
have done it?" he exclaimed; and Jewel burst into tears,
sobbing out that she had been so wretched, and wanted
some one to sympathize with her so much, that she could
not help speaking.</p>

<p>He waited till she had done sobbing, then asked:</p>

<p>"And the people in Virginia&mdash;your old home. You let
them know the truth at least. You promised me you
would as soon as the Reverend Mr. Archer came home
from Europe."</p>

<p>"But he never came home," Jewel answered.</p>

<p>And he told himself that he was mistaken in fancying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that there was a ring of malicious triumph in her voice.
Surely she would be only too glad to have the honor of her
sister vindicated, and he echoed, dismally:</p>

<p>"Never came home!"</p>

<p>"No; he died abroad," said Jewel, and, after waiting a
few moments, she added: "What was the use of speaking
then? No one would have believed me. Besides, very
few knew anything about poor Flower's trouble at the
time, and to bring it up again would have made a fresh
scandal, so I thought it best not to speak."</p>

<p>And against his better judgment she persuaded Laurie
Meredith to keep the secret of the past.</p>

<p>Several months after Laurie Meredith's return to Boston,
the following notice appeared in the society column
of a daily paper:</p>

<blockquote>

the young lady referred to as Lord Ivon's great-granddaughter
was standing alone at a window, looking
out, with wistful, azure eyes, at the whirling flakes of
snow that filled the air, for it had been snowing since early
morn, and the earth was already covered in the short space
of three hours with a deep, glistening, white carpet.</p>

<p>None of the reports regarding Azalia Brooke's beauty
were in the least exaggerated, for she was, indeed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Perfectly beautiful, faultily faultless."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A form of perfect mold and medium height, with a
rarely lovely face, lighted by large purple-blue eyes, and
framed by burnished, golden hair; hands and feet perfect
enough for a sculptor's model, and a voice that was sweet
as the soul of music, no wonder people raved over Lord
Ivon's great-granddaughter; for as she stood there, with
the rich, plush folds of her pale-blue, ermine-trimmed tea-gown
falling in long, statuesque folds about her, she
looked as if she had stepped down from an artist's canvas,
or from the pages of a poet's book.</p>

<p>But as the lovely girl gazed at the snowy scene without,
an expression of wistful sadness crept around the corners
of her curved red lips and into her tender blue eyes,
and she repeated some pathetic lines that have touched
many a heart with their sweet, simple pathos:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How strange it should be that the beautiful snow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How strange it should be if ere night comes again<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The snow and the ice strike my desperate brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Fainting,<br /></span>
<span class="i21">Freezing,<br /></span>
<span class="i31">Dying alone,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To be heard in the crash of the crazy town,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I should be, and should lie in my terrible woe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Great pearly tears rose to the pansy-blue eyes, brimmed
over, and rolled down the fair cheeks of the girl. She
clasped her little hands, all glittering with diamonds, and
murmured, mournfully:</p>

<p>"Ah, my mother, to think that you were a sinner like
that!&mdash;'Too wicked for prayer,' a willful sinner for
love's sake, and I, your child, with that dark brand upon
my birth! Ah, what if he had lived to know? He was
proud and well-born. Would he have hated me for my
mother's sin? Would he have forsaken me, cast me off as
one unworthy? Ah, my love, my love, it was better that
you died, for then you never knew the cruel truth!"</p>

<p>The door opened softly, and a servant entered, placing
the evening papers on the table. To divert her thoughts,
which had grown dark and gloomy, Lord Ivon's great-granddaughter
threw herself into a luxurious chair, and
began to peruse the first paper that came to her hand.
Thus she came upon the paragraph regarding Laurie
Meredith and Jewel Fielding.</p>

<p>What ailed Azalia Brooke, the beautiful descendant of
the proud house of Ivon?</p>

<p>When her glance fell carelessly on those two names she
started, and a low cry of wonder came from her lips.</p>

<p>Twice over she read the paragraph, and her cheeks assumed
the hue of death, her eyes were dilated widely, her
lips parted and gasped, faintly:</p>

<p>"Jewel here&mdash;and to be married to Laurie Meredith!
Laurie Meredith! Great Heaven, could there be two of
that name?"</p>

<p>She crushed the paper convulsively in her slender fingers,
and stared before her with wide, blue eyes that saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
not the luxurious appointments of the elegant room, but
a picture evoked from the recesses of her brain&mdash;a picture
of the past.</p>

<p>A rocky, sea-beat shore, with the soft breeze of summer
lifting the golden curls from a girl's white brow as it
rested against a manly breast. Blue eyes were meeting
brown ones, hand was clasped in hand, and love was lord
of that tender scene.</p>

<p>A moan of pain came from the lips of beautiful Azalia,
and she sighed:</p>

<p>"Ah, love, why did you leave me, without a word, to my
cruel fate? Were you false in heart? Were you only
amusing yourself with the simple child who loved you so
well? Was that marriage true, or only a sham, or was
there treachery somewhere? Treachery! It looked at me
from Jewel's eyes&mdash;treachery and murderous hate! Ah,
love, you died so soon after you went away that I can not
hate you in your grave, even though you doomed me to a
wretched life, cursed with memories that will not die!
And I&mdash;I&mdash;would give the world to know the truth&mdash;to
solve the mystery of your going that night!"</p>

<p>The low voice broke again, and she leaned back pale
and silent, and a sadder picture rose in fancy before the
fixed blue eyes.</p>

<p>This time it was of a golden-haired, blue-eyed girl, with
a wailing infant on her breast&mdash;a girl who had sought refuge
from danger in an humble negro cabin. Over her was
bending a plump, good-looking mulatto woman, and the
girl was praying, feebly:</p>

<p>"Take me away from here! Hide me and my baby
from our enemy!"</p>

<p>The mulatto woman had acted the part of the good
Samaritan to the helpless, suffering girl. All night she
had worked hard preparing a place in an old, unused
barn, where she could hide the sick mother and the tiny
babe, and care for them in secret. So it happened that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
through her care and prudence, the mother and child
fared well, and remained undiscovered in their miserable
retreat, while weeks sped away and the world accepted
Jewel Fielding's assertion that her sister was dead&mdash;drowned
in the deep sea.</p>

<p>At last four weary, interminable weeks passed away,
and the beautiful young mother was growing strong and
well again. On the morrow she had planned to take her
baby in her arms and fly from the place so fraught with
perils. She said to the good friend who had cared for her
so nobly, that she must go into the world and work for a
living for herself and the child.</p>

<p>But when that morrow dawned&mdash;and at the picture that
rose in her mind Azalia sobbed aloud&mdash;the girl awoke from
slumber and found beneath her breast a little, pulseless
form, from which breath had so lately fled that the body
was still limp and warm. Poor, puny babe! its feeble little
life was ended, she thought, as she clasped and kissed
it with raining tears and breaking heart.</p>

<p>A few minutes later her good friend came in and found
what had happened. She mingled her tears with those of
the bereaved mother.</p>

<p>But they had little time to weep together, for presently
Poky said, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, this is dreadful! I don't know what to do!
Sam and me had a dreadful fuss this morning, and he
said I gadded about too much, and he's gwine ter watch
and see whar I goes ter. He's been a-drinkin' agin,
the most owdacious raskil he is in his drams that I
ever see in all my born days! Cross as a boar with a sore
head, dat he is!"</p>

<p>The moaning girl, who was rocking the dead baby on
breast, uttered a cry of fear, and Poky continued:</p>

<p>"De reason why he's got ter drinkin' and cuttin' up
ag'in is case why somebuddy has up an' robbed him
whilst he war away courtin' me. You don't happen ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
know nothin' 'bout some papers dat was hid under de flatstone
ob de h'arth, does you, Miss Flower, honey?" Poky
whispered, anxiously.</p>

<p>In her great grief over her dead child, Flower could not
remember for a moment, and she was about to reply in
the negative, when suddenly there flashed over her a memory
of the night when Mrs. Fielding had gone mad and attempted
her life.</p>

<p>She remembered what Jewel had uttered so triumphantly
that night, declaring that she had found the papers that
her mother had sought in vain in the cabin&mdash;the fatal
diary of Charley Fielding.</p>

<p>Flower hesitated a moment lest she should do wrong in
betraying her half-sister; then her gratitude to this good
woman overpowered all other considerations, and she told
her briefly that Jewel had taken the papers, but that they
related to important family matters alone, and could have
been of no use to Sam.</p>

<p>Poky was glad to find out so much, and then she took
the little child gently from the weeping mother, and,
folding it reverently in her shawl, said, gently, though
anxiously:</p>

<p>"Honey, I don't want ter skeer yer, but dis death will
happen ter make trouble lessen I could bury de baby private
like without anybuddy knowing. Is you willin' to
trust me?"</p>

<p>Flower only repeated, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>Then Poky went on to explain that if the secret they
had been keeping became known it might be suspected that
they had murdered the baby to get rid of it.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;murder my little, brown-eyed boy&mdash;my precious
Douglas!" the young mother cried, indignantly; but
Poky persisted, adding, gravely:</p>

<p>"Miss Jewel Fielding would egg them on, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
chile, and so I think you'd better run away now and leabe
me to bury de poor baby."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>It seemed terrible to poor Flower to leave her little one
to be consigned to an unknown grave by this humble
friend; but Poky's good counsel prevailed at last, and with
one last kiss on the lovely little face, she stole away in the
rough disguise Poky had provided for her, and began her
battle with the cold world.</p>

<p>Poky had generously bestowed on her a little money,
and with this she made her way to the little Southern town
where she had been born, determined to learn something
of her mother's history, and also believing that she might
make an humble living here better than among the human
wolves of a great city.</p>

<p>First of all, she sought humble lodgings at a little third-class
hotel, and here she soon learned the location of the
cemetery, and set out to visit the graves of her father and
mother.</p>

<p>She had no difficulty in finding the handsome inclosure
wherein all of the dead and gone Fieldings were interred.
It was the pride of the cemetery, just as the Fieldings had
been the pride of the town ere their last descendant, handsome,
erring, wretched Charley Fielding had flung himself
madly into a suicide's awful grave.</p>

<p>Flower sat down among the cold marble monuments,
trailing vines, and sweet tea-roses, and fixed her eyes on
the small, unpretentious stone that recorded the death of
her wretched young father.</p>

<p>Out of her abundant wealth his widow had spared but
little for his grave-stone. Her resentment had been too
strong and enduring, and followed him beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Crushed and despairing, the unhappy girl sat among
the graves of her ancestors, with her golden head bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
low as she reflected that the bond that united them was
one of bitter shame and woe.</p>

<p>It was too hard to linger there long, bowed down with
shame and sorrow. She moved away presently to seek the
place where her erring mother had been laid to rest, and
so came upon the old sexton busily digging a grave.
There were a few loiterers about, and a veiled lady sat in
the shadow of a weeping willow near by, but Flower
noticed no one. She went toward the old man, and
asked, timidly:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me where to find the grave of Daisy Forrest?"</p>

<p>The old man looked up, their eyes met, he staggered
back, and dropped his spade, uttering a cry of terror:</p>

<p>"Good Lord deliver me!"</p>

<p>The veiled lady, under the drooping branches of the willow,
did not seem to notice, but some of the people who
were walking about the paths came closer, curious to
know what had happened to the old sexton.</p>

<p>He was staring at Flower with frightened eyes, as if she
had been a ghost.</p>

<p>"My good man, I did not mean to startle you," Flower
said, in her low voice, that sounded like saddest music.
"I am looking for my mother's grave."</p>

<p>"Oh, my good Lord! this is surely her ghost!" gasped
the sexton, retreating still further. "Oh, I told Mrs.
Fielding it was a sin to do this, but she would not listen,
she would have her way! It was a shame for me to obey
her. And now I'm punished, for Daisy Forrest has come
from her grave to look at me and reproach me!"</p>

<p>Some one touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Old man, you're daft. It's a living woman speaking
to you."</p>

<p>"What, with that voice and that face?" muttered the
old man, dubiously. He peered fearfully at Flower, and
muttered, "If 'tain't her ghost, they're as like as two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
peas! Well, ma'am, and what is't you're wanting to
know?"</p>

<p>"To find Daisy Forrest's grave," said the low, sad
voice, with a pitiful tremor in its sweetness; and with that
the old man took up his spade and struck it down into
the open grave.</p>

<p>"This is where we buried her nigh onto eighteen years
ago," he said, peering curiously into her startled face, as
she cried out in horror:</p>

<p>"Why do you thus desecrate her grave, man?"</p>

<p>The sound of her indignant voice reached the veiled
woman. She started as from a deep trance, and came
hastily forward toward the little group that had collected
about the grave.</p>

<p>Throwing back her thick veil, she exclaimed, harshly:</p>

<p>"What is all this excitement, old man? I commanded
you to perform this work quietly and in silence."</p>

<p>Flower drew back with a startled cry. It was Mrs.
Fielding.</p>

<p>The old sexton had leaped into the grave. There was a
sound as of the tearing of rotten planks. A minute's
silence, then he looked up at the imperious woman, whose
eyes burned like fire under her dark brows and snowy-white
hair.</p>

<p>"The Lord has put your foolish vengeance out of your
power, ma'am," he said, with stern awe. "There ain't
nothin' here but a little heap o' ashes. I told you so; I
told you that poor, wronged woman was dust and ashes
along o' your little babby. But you wouldn't listen.
Look, now, for yourself."</p>

<p>She moved forward, as did all the group, except the
frightened, shrinking Flower, and when she saw, down
there in the darkness of the grave, the commingling ashes
of her dead rival and her dead child she uttered a tigerish
cry of rage and hate, and fell in a swoon upon the green
turf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>At that sight Flower forgot everything, except that
the unconscious woman had given her for seventeen years
a mother's love and received from her a child's affection.
She ran to Mrs. Fielding's side, knelt by her, loosened her
dress at the throat, and tore off the heavy veil to give her
air.</p>

<p>"Come, sexton, what is all this? Why did you open
Daisy Forrest's grave?" a stern voice demanded of the
sexton, who was already hastening to replace the earth
upon the violated grave.</p>

<p>The old man looked up, and saw a tall man of about
fifty, stoutly built, plainly dressed, and wearing gray
whiskers of an English cut. There was a gleam of stern
displeasure in his eyes, and the sexton answered, sulkily:</p>

<p>"I don't know as it's any of your business, stranger;
the lady had a permit from the authorities to open this
grave."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>But other voices besides those of the English-looking
stranger clamored loudly for reasons, so the old sexton,
with a sulky glance at his interlocutor, proceeded to explain
to his friends and neighbors, giving in substance the
story with which we are already familiar.</p>

<p>When he had finished his voluble story he drew a long
breath, and added:</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, I knowed 'em all&mdash;poor Daisy, and
Charley, and Maria, and all, for I've been sexton at
Springville nigh on to forty year. So, as I was a-saying,
after Maria confessed that cheat on her death-bed, Mrs.
Fielding felt like she couldn't see no rest till she took her
child outer the coffin with poor Daisy Forrest. So she
get the permit, and just teased and teased, and coaxed
and begged, until I had to give in and consent."</p>

<p>"And you were finely imposed on by the story of a mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
woman!" exclaimed a sneering voice, and three strangers
came quickly upon the scene. The one who had spoken
was a medical-looking man with a sinister countenance,
and he continued: "Why, my good friend, this is a mad
woman who recently escaped from my asylum. I have
been seeking her everywhere, and I count myself lucky in
finding her at last, for she is very violent at times, and
quite capable of murder."</p>

<p>Incredulous voices rose on the air, and Flower rose, pale
and trembling, saying, in her low, clear tones:</p>

<p>"I do not know this gentleman, but it is quite true that
the lady is mad. I know her well. She was sent to an
insane asylum weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Then the story she has told is untrue, a figment of
her disordered imagination," said the English-looking
stranger, who had offended the sexton.</p>

<p>"No, it is the truth," Flower answered, taming her
earnest gaze on his face, and adding: "It was the knowledge
of that truth that turned her dark hair white in one
night, and afterward drove her to madness. And I am
the helpless girl she reared as her own&mdash;I am Daisy Forrest's
daughter!"</p>

<p>No one thought of doubting her assertion. There she
stood, looking at them with the face of her whose ashes
slept beneath their feet, and awing all denial into silence.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Fielding stirred, and opened her dark
eyes with a dazed look. Flower bent over her with infinite
pity in her sad blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" she murmured, using the old, familiar
name forgetfully.</p>

<p>"Flower!" exclaimed Mrs. Fielding, wildly, and there
was a note of gladness in her voice that was plainly recognized
by all. For the moment the poor woman had forgotten
all but the love she had borne the girl who had
been her daughter so long. Her wild expression softened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
into sweetness, and murmuring, "My darling!" she held
out her arms to the girl, who gently assisted her to rise.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Fielding saw the half-filled grave yawning at
her feet, saw the curious faces around her, and fell memory
returned.</p>

<p>She glared wildly at Flower's gentle, pitying face, and
struck out fiercely with both hands to push her away.</p>

<p>"Ah, I forgot!" she screamed, angrily. "You do not
belong to me&mdash;you are hers! Go&mdash;go, before I strike you!
Go&mdash;"</p>

<p>But further speech was arrested by the doctor, whom she
had not before observed, but who now came in front of
her, and said, sharply:</p>

<p>"Come, Mrs. Fielding, enough of this! You must
come home now with me and these keepers who came
along with me to help carry you back."</p>

<p>A scream of horror broke from the poor woman's lips;
but they proceeded to pinion her hands firmly, regardless
of the wild entreaties for freedom that she eagerly poured forth.</p>

<p>"Oh, be gentle; do not hurt her, if you must take her
away!" Flower exclaimed, pleadingly; and at that Mrs.
Fielding looked at her almost tenderly and wailed out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Flower, do not let them take me away! I am
not mad&mdash;I am not mad! Oh, save me&mdash;you are my only
friend!"</p>

<p>Smothering her wild cries with a handkerchief, the three
men bore her rapidly away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>When Flower saw the miserable Mrs. Fielding borne
away so rudely by her captors her tender heart swelled
with pity for the unhappy woman, and she started to run
after them to beg them to be gentler with the poor creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>But she had not taken a dozen steps before her arm was
caught in a tight grasp by the old sexton, who whirled her
about, and said, sharply:</p>

<p>"What would you do? Run after that mad woman,
who hates you?"</p>

<p>Tears sprung to Flower's eyes, and she answered, sadly:</p>

<p>"But she loved me once, before she found out how
cruelly she had been imposed on, and I pity her now, for
her last words sounded quite rational. Perhaps she has
got over her madness."</p>

<p>"Humph! It didn't sound like it just now when she
was rating you so soundly!" grunted the old man; and
feeling her tremble as he held her arm, he looked keenly
into her face, and saw that she was deathly pale and wan.</p>

<p>"You're just ready to faint, missie," he exclaimed,
leading her to the rustic seat beneath the willow, where
Mrs. Fielding had been sitting a little while ago. He
brought her a draught of fresh, sparkling water, which
she drank thirstily, then, with a deep sigh, leaned her aching
head on her hands.</p>

<p>Divining that she wished to be alone, the kind-hearted
old sexton returned to his task of filling up the grave of
Daisy Forrest, and the loiterers about the spot slowly dispersed,
with one notable exception&mdash;that of the gray-haired
English-looking stranger who had offended the old
sexton by his authoritative manner.</p>

<p>This man now approached, and said, in a bluff, hearty
manner:</p>

<p>"Old man, I did not mean to offend by my speech just
now; but I, too, knew something of Daisy Forrest's history,
and I was indignant at the deed Mrs. Fielding would
have done. I hope you will accept this peace-offering
from one who wishes you nothing but kindness."</p>

<p>The kind, gray eyes looking at him enforced the speech
so emphatically that the sexton melted at once, and replied
in kindly terms, while gratefully accepting the offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
gold-piece which, like the donor, had an English appearance.</p>

<p>Then the stranger moved away and sought Flower, who
was sobbing violently now in her seat under the willows.
At the sound of his step she raised to his face the beautiful
eyes, all drowned in tears, like purple-blue pansies wet
with dew.</p>

<p>He stopped beside her, and said, gently:</p>

<p>"Miss Fielding, this is an opportune meeting for you
and me."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, sir," said Flower, in a
sweet, timid voice, and he answered, quietly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but I will soon explain to you. Still,
this may not be a proper place to begin my story. There is
my card. Will you permit me, an old man, and the
friend of yourself and your kindred, to call upon you at
your home?"</p>

<p>She looked at the bit of pasteboard, and read the name,
scrawled in a bold hand:</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">William R. Kelso</span>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"London, England."<br />
</p>

<p>Lifting her sad eyes to his face, she said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelso, I am staying at the Springville Hotel. I
have no home. I was driven from Mrs. Fielding's house,
after she was sent to the asylum, by the cruelty of my
half-sister. I am indebted to the kindness of a poor colored
woman for the means that enabled me to reach this
place. I must now seek work that I may have the means
of prolonging my miserable existence."</p>

<p>Something like a smile crossed the man's lips at her
concluding words, and a grieved look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>Why should he smile at her sorrows, she wondered.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for smiling. I know you think me
unfeeling," he said. "But you will understand me better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
when you have heard the good news I have to tell
you."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a startled face, and murmured
piteously, as she clasped her little hands together:</p>

<p>"Good news, you say! Ah, if you have anything like
that to tell me, do not wait! Let me hear it now! But,
alas! what good fortune could come to me?" despondently,
for the quick thought of Laurie Meredith was turned
aside by the remembrance that he was dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelso seated himself on the rustic bench beside her,
and said, earnestly:</p>

<p>"What if I should tell you that I came recently from
England to seek Daisy Forrest and her descendants?"</p>

<p>The quivering red lips parted in wonder, but Flower
did not speak, and he continued:</p>

<p>"I suppose you have never heard that your maternal
grandfather was English?"</p>

<p>Her lips quivered painfully as she answered:</p>

<p>"No, I know nothing, except that my birth was my
mother's shame, and the cause of her death."</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" sighed William Kelso, compassionately,
then he added: "Yes, he was the younger son of a noble
English family. His eldest brother was heir to the title
and estates, the second brother was in the army, and John
Forrest, the third and last, was designed for the church.
He was young and wild, and revolted against the restraints
of a clerical life, and ran away to America."</p>

<p>Flower sat up, listening eagerly. This began to sound
like one of her favorite novels.</p>

<p>Smiling sympathetically at the lovely, startled face, Mr.
Kelso continued:</p>

<p>"Lord Ivon was both stern and proud. He vowed he
would never forgive his disobedient, runaway son. When
letters came from him they were laid aside unread, and
poor John's fate remained a mystery to his kindred. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mother pined, but her stern husband forbid her ever to
think of the truant again."</p>

<p>"He was cruel!" Flower murmured, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was very hard; but Heaven punished him!"
said William Kelso. "The heir died in a few years, and
the second son came home from the army to take his
place. He married late in life, and his beautiful, delicate
wife bore him two sons, and then died. Her husband was
drowned a year later on Lake Como. His two boys inherited
their mother's consumptive tendency, and one
died in early boyhood, and the other just before he attained
his majority. Lord Ivon's house was left unto him
desolate."</p>

<p>Flower sighed, and he continued:</p>

<p>"There was no one to inherit the title and estates unless
John Forrest had survived his brothers, or had married
and left descendants. So the letters that had been
flung aside at last were opened eagerly to discover John
Forrest's whereabouts. There were scores of them, for
he had never ceased to implore his parents for their forgiveness.
He wrote that he was here in the South, that
he had married a lovely girl, then that he had a lovely
child called Daisy."</p>

<p>"My mother!" Flower exclaimed, sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, your mother!" said Mr. Kelso.</p>

<p>He paused a moment, watching the long shadows of
sunset as they began to creep across the grave-stones in
the old cemetery; then he resumed:</p>

<p>"After the letter that told of Daisy Forrest's birth, no
more came to Lord Ivon, and he supposed that his son
had grown tired of writing, and had reconciled himself to
the alienation. Alas! poor John was dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" exclaimed Flower.</p>

<p>"Yes, although his father knows it not yet," said Mr.
Kelso. "You remember all this was thirty-seven years
ago, Miss Fielding. Well, to resume my story, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Ivon's heart turned to his younger son when all his other
descendants were gone, and he came to me, his lawyer,
and begged me to cross the ocean and seek an heir to
Ivon."</p>

<p>"Alas!" sighed Flower, thinking of the little dead baby
she had kissed and left in Poky's arms. Had it lived&mdash;her
lovely little child&mdash;it would have been heir to one of
the finest titles and estates in old England.</p>

<p>"So I came to this place," continued Mr. Kelso. "I
have been here little more than a week, but I have had no
trouble in tracing John Forrest, for many of the old people
in the country about here remember him well. It
seems he had poor luck, or perhaps his training as a rich
man's son had not fitted him to encounter the hardships
of life. He drifted down here from New York, and obtained
employment as an overseer on a farm. Soon after
he married the farmer's only child, a sweet girl named
Mary. A year after Daisy was born, and her father died
soon afterward with malarial fever. His wife survived
until her daughter was ten years old, and, dying, left her
to take care of her farmer grandparents. They died when
Daisy was seventeen, and the farm was sold to satisfy a
mortgage, and the beautiful granddaughter was thrown
upon the world, helpless and penniless. She went into a
grand family as a nursery governess, met Charley Fielding,
and&mdash;the rest you know."</p>

<p>Her low moan of pain attested that she did, and for a
moment there was a deep silence.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Kelso resumed:</p>

<p>"They told me that Daisy Forrest was dead, and her
child, too, and I came here this afternoon to look at her
grave before I went back to England to tell Lord Ivon
with him the proud title and name must die. I am
happy that I am spared this sorrowful task, for I
think that after you have examined my credentials you
will not hesitate to secure a maid and return with me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
England that I may place you in the care of your great-grandparents."</p>

<p>He saw the old sexton, who had now replaced the turf
and flowers on Daisy Forrest's grave, looking at them
curiously as he leaned on his spade, and he beckoned him
to approach.</p>

<p>Then he gave the old man a brief account of John Forrest's
story, telling him that his father had been a rich
man, and that poor Daisy's child was going home with him
to live with her grandparents. He did not tell him that this
great-grandfather was a nobleman, thinking that Flower
would not wish to create too much sensation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>It was of all these stirring events that Azalia Brooks
was thinking as she sat in Raynold Clinton's library,
crushing in her jeweled hands the paper that held those
two names with their magic power to evoke the past, her
sad eyes full of retrospection, her heart heavy with pain.</p>

<p>Since that May day, more than two years ago, when
William Kelso had so opportunely found her beside her
mother's grave, she had been a most fortunate girl, for
Lord Ivon and his wife, in their loneliness and their desire
for an heir to reign after them, welcomed her with open
arms, overlooked the dark stain upon her birth, and only
stipulated that it should be kept from the knowledge of
the world. In order to further this end, and to destroy
her identity with Daisy Forrest's illegitimate daughter,
they changed her name to Azalia Brooke, and as no one in
England knew any better, except William Kelso, who kept
the secret inviolate, her right to the name remained undisputed.
She remained for a year secluded at Lord
Ivon's magnificent country house in Cornwall, under the
care of accomplished governesses and masters, and when
she was presented in society created the greatest <i>furore</i> by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
her grace and beauty. The lovely American, as she was
called, was all the rage, and scores of suitors bowed before
her, but all in vain, for no one ever awakened her heart,
they said, and Lord and Lady Ivon began to feel sorely
disappointed. They had hoped she would fall in love with
some of her noble suitors and marry.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have left a lover in America, dear?"
Lady Ivon said, anxiously, one day; and she never forgot
the look of pain that shadowed the beautiful face as Azalia
replied:</p>

<p>"No, grandmamma, I did not. I never had but one
lover, and he died in a few months after we became acquainted."</p>

<p>"But you must have been so very young at the time
that you could not have cared for him so very much,"
said Lady Ivon, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was very young," Azalia answered, dreamily;
but she added to herself that she cared so much that she
should never forget her dead husband, and sighed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forget thee? Yes, when life shall cease<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To thrill this heart of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But not till then can I forget<br /></span>
<span class="i3">One look or tone of thine!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a burden on her heart&mdash;the burden of the
secret she had not dared to confess either to Mr. Kelso or
to her great-grandparents.</p>

<p>She feared that they would not receive her if she confessed
that she had been married in secret to a man who
had deserted her so strangely, and that she had borne a
little child that was dead and had been buried in a secret
grave.</p>

<p>"If I told them they might say, like Jewel, that it was
all a sham, that the man had deceived me," she thought,
with burning cheeks. "They might drive me out into
the cold, hard world, of which I am so terribly afraid.
No, no, I dare not speak!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>So she kept her sorrowful secret hidden in her own
heart; and when Lady Ivon sometimes caught that look
of sad retrospection on the fair face, she thought that she
was thinking of a dead lover&mdash;not a dead husband and
child.</p>

<p>"I fear that she must have cared more than I suspected,"
the old lady would say to herself, uneasily; and,
could she have gazed upon Azalia now, she would have
felt more anxious than ever.</p>

<p>She said to herself that she must find out the truth as
to this Laurie Meredith. But how to accomplish it was
the question that occurred to her, since she dare not ask
any questions.</p>

<p>No answer presented itself to her mind, and she could
only hope that she might meet this Laurie Meredith in society.</p>

<p>"But what if I should meet Jewel, too? Would she
recognize me? Would she tax me with my identity? If
she did, I should not acknowledge the
truth."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>It was perhaps a week after that snowy day when Azalia
Brooke sat, looking back with dim, wet eyes into her
shadowy past, that Jewel Fielding reclined at ease in a
beautiful boudoir hung in white and gold, and listened to
the roar of the winter wind as it whistled in the eaves of
the handsome but ancient old mansion that she called
home.</p>

<p>The house had been built by an Englishman almost a
century ago, and outside it looked like a small-sized castle,
while within it was of peculiar construction, having some
very large and beautiful rooms, with others so small and
ill-ventilated that Jewel turned up her pretty nose at
them, declaring that they were stuffy holes, fit for nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that she could see but lumber-closets. There was a
great, big, noisome cellar under the house, too, that in
winter often stood feet deep in water, and was therefore
never used for any purpose, but given over to the use and
occupancy of immense rats.</p>

<p>But there were plenty of elegant, comfortable rooms in
the grand house, and the beautiful boudoir where Jewel
lay was fine enough for a queen, and Jewel herself was not
unlike a queen in her purple velvet robe, with its border
of silvery fur that was so becoming to the dusky beauty of
her dark, sparkling face, with its crown of jetty braided
hair.</p>

<p>It was a gloomy, overcast afternoon, with a keen, north-east
wind blowing, and heavy patches of last week's deep
snow still cumbering the ground. But the curtains were
drawn and the gas ablaze in Jewel's room, while the leaping
flames inside the grate added tropical warmth to the
large room with its beautiful furniture and tall stands of
blooming flowers.</p>

<p>Jewel's eyes were shining with pleasure, for her maid
had just brought in for her inspection a new dress that
she was to wear that night&mdash;a marvel of richness, a stately
purple brocade and plush, in which, with her costly diamonds,
Jewel knew that she would look imperially lovely.</p>

<p>"Leave it there, Marie," she said to the pert French
maid with her dainty, beribboned cap; "I wish to study
the fall of the drapery at my leisure. I will ring when I
desire you."</p>

<p>Marie bowed and withdrew, and the vain beauty lay idly
at full length, her arms thrown over her head, her dainty
slipper tapping the carpet, and feasted her dark eyes on
the shining robe.</p>

<p>"I shall look like a queen&mdash;there will be no one to rival
me!" she declared, triumphantly. "Let me see, what
flowers shall I wear?&mdash;crimson roses, or creamy-white
ones? Or the delicate gold of the Marchal Niel? I declare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
I can not make up my mind. I shall have to let
Marie decide. She has exquisite taste."</p>

<p>Suddenly a slight frown wrinkled the beautiful forehead,
and the dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Ah, I forgot," she muttered. "They say that that
English beauty will be there! Pshaw! What does it matter?
I shall eclipse my Lord Ivon's great-granddaughter,
in spite of the prestige of her position, for they say she is
a blonde, and her pink-and-white charms will stand no
chance against my brunette beauty. All blondes look insipid.
I never saw but one that could hold her own
against me, and that was my twin sister&mdash;ah, I forgot&mdash;I
mean Flower."</p>

<p>She shivered a little, and the slow opening of the door
gave her a violent start.</p>

<p>It was Marie, who had been flirting with the postman at
the door.</p>

<p>She carried a letter on a salver.</p>

<p>Jewel snatched it up eagerly, and dismissed her maid.</p>

<p>In a moment she had drawn the letter from the envelope
and was quickly perusing it.</p>

<p>Her face darkened with anger, and she gnawed her
crimson lower lip sharply with her pearly teeth, muttering
vindictively:</p>

<p>"I will not do it&mdash;never, never! She shall stay there
till she dies!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Again the door opened, and Jewel thrust the letter
into the envelope and slipped her hand down among the
folds of her rich gown.</p>

<p>"Marie, what do you mean by interrupting me like
this?" she broke out, petulantly.</p>

<p>Marie courtesied, apologized, and explained that a lady,
a woman, had called to see Miss Fielding, and would not
be denied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by a lady, a woman?" Jewel
mimicked, impatiently; and the maid explained, in broken
French, that the caller had a high-bred voice and air, but
was dressed very shabbily, and had come on foot.</p>

<p>"Her name?" Jewel demanded.</p>

<p>But the shabby caller had given the maid no card.</p>

<p>"Why did you not send her to Mrs. Wellings since she
would not go away?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wellings had gone to her room with a headache,
and desired no one to disturb her in the little nap with
which she proposed to while away the dull afternoon.</p>

<p>"Headache! too much wine at luncheon!" Jewel muttered,
scornfully; and then, having nothing else to do, and
being of a curious disposition, she said, lightly: "Go,
and show your impertinent shabby lady up here, Marie,
and I will find out what she wishes. A beggar, perhaps&mdash;insolent
creature!"</p>

<p>Marie withdrew, and Jewel threw herself into an attitude
of studied grace, the better to impress the caller,
whom she opined was some poor creature, a needle-woman
desiring work, most probably.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a slight, dark figure, very poorly
dressed, indeed, followed Marie over the threshold and
stood there hesitating. Jewel looked at her curiously,
but a dark veil was drawn over the features of the unknown.</p>

<p>"Well?" she interrogated, curtly and haughtily.</p>

<p>"Send your maid away, please, Miss Fielding," said a
low, imploring voice that made Jewel start in spite of her
haughty self-command. She immediately motioned Marie
away, and, rising quickly, turned the key in the lock after
her exit.</p>

<p>Then, with a swift tremor shaking her whole frame, she
confronted the veiled figure.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, sharply, and the veil was flung aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
by an agitated hand, and Jewel and Flower, the long-parted
half-sisters, the beautiful rivals, stood face to face!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Something like a groan of despair came from Jewel's
blanched lips, and Flower said, bitterly:</p>

<p>"You know me!"</p>

<p>Jewel was not taken wholly by surprise. She had been
looking for something like this for two years, never having
quite believed her own story of Flower's suicide. She
remained silent a moment, collecting her thoughts, then
said, coldly:</p>

<p>"I have believed you dead for two years, but the moment
you spoke I knew your voice. I never heard a voice
quite like yours. But where have you been so long, and
what has brought you here to-night?"</p>

<p>Flower, whose beautiful face was wan and ghastly
white, answered, with sudden passion:</p>

<p>"It matters not where I have been, since it is evident
you were glad to believe me dead. But I will tell you
why I am here, Jewel!" and she drew from beneath her
long, black water-proof a worn newspaper, and held it out
to Jewel. "You have read this paragraph, of course?"
she said. "Tell me what it means, or I shall go mad!"</p>

<p>The dark eyes glanced at the short paragraph, the red
lips parted in a malicious smile, and Jewel said, airily:</p>

<p>"It means what it says, of course."</p>

<p>She saw the slight, graceful form shiver with emotion,
the blue eyes dilate widely.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jewel!" gasped the girl, pleadingly. "This
Laurie Meredith&mdash;who is he?"</p>

<p>Jewel gave utterance to a low, mocking laugh, and answered:</p>

<p>"Not the dead alive, certainly; for although you have
come back from your supposed grave, your old lover has
not. I could keep you in suspense awhile, but I see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
are not able to bear it, so I will tell you at once that this
man whom I am so soon to marry is a cousin of your
Laurie Meredith."</p>

<p>"A cousin!" Flower faltered, disappointedly, plainly
betraying the wild hope that had lurked in her heart, and
causing Jewel to exclaim sharply:</p>

<p>"Why, of course! You could not suppose it was the
same man after you read his death in the paper."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;thought&mdash;hoped, it might be a mistake&mdash;that it
was some one else who was dead&mdash;not my husband! Oh,
I can not tell what I hoped when I saw that dear name in
the paper again!" wailed Flower; and unable to stand
longer, she sunk upon the velvet couch, and sobbed heart-brokenly.</p>

<p>Jewel watched the bowed, golden head with a terrible
hatred, a panther-like fury in her large, black eyes, and
clinching her white teeth fiercely, she said to herself:</p>

<p>"Ah, I did not know what a hell of hate was in my
heart until this weak girl came between me and my
heart's beloved! I can understand now how my mother
hated her mother! I can feel the same murderous jealousy
that made her life wretched! Ah, what am I to do?
She is alive, she is in the same city with Laurie Meredith,
and they will surely find each other out despite all my lies
and all my schemes."</p>

<p>Dark, terrible thoughts came into her mind. She
wished that she could see her sister fall down dead at her
feet, so bitter was her hate.</p>

<p>Suddenly Flower lifted her beautiful, pathetic face, and
a gleam of her old spirit shone in her eyes. She exclaimed,
warningly:</p>

<p>"Jewel, I warn you not to deceive me! If it be really
Laurie Meredith, if it was not he who died, tell me the
truth! What could it profit you to keep us apart now? I
remember that you used to love him, that you were angry
because he preferred me, but even if he had learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
love you, believing me dead, you could not be his wife
now&mdash;now, while I am alive!"</p>

<p>A cruel, mocking laugh came from Jewel's writhing
lips. She bent forward, and hissed, vindictively:</p>

<p>"You were always a fool, Flower! You never would
listen to me when I told you that Laurie Meredith fooled
you into an illegal marriage. Now, as you demand the
truth, you shall have it. Laurie Meredith was a married
man when he first came to our sea-side home, had a young
wife in Boston when he betrayed you. She found out his
treachery somehow, and that was why he left Virginia so
suddenly. She was so imbittered by his wickedness that
they say she did not shed a tear when he died, and in a
short time she sold all her property here and went abroad,
never to return."</p>

<p>"No, no; I will not believe he could be so wicked,"
came in a whisper of agony from Flower's white lips.
"Oh, Jewel, how did you learn all this?"</p>

<p>"From my betrothed, the cousin of your heartless betrayer,"
Jewel replied, coolly; and a short silence fell between
the two.</p>

<p>Then Flower exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Jewel, I should like to see this man! I should like to
hear from his own lips&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jewel recoiled in horror.</p>

<p>"You are mad!" she cried. "Do you think I would
permit it, that I would own you, the half-sister whose
kinship to me is her disgrace and a brand on the memory
of my dead father?"</p>

<p>She turned her back on the poor girl with a disdainful
gesture, and swept toward the fire, and stood there with
her pretty pointed slipper on the fender, murderous
thoughts rising in her heart.</p>

<p>"I could kill her, I hate and fear her so much!" she
thought, hotly.</p>

<p>Flower's tear-wet eyes had fallen to the floor. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fastened on an envelope lying close to her feet half under
the folds of her dress. She saw the name of her sister on
the upper side.</p>

<p>She did not feel much interest in the letter. She could
not understand afterward, when she came to think of it
soberly, why she had picked it up and hid it in her breast.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel moved from her position in front of the fire,
and trailed the beautiful folds of her purple velvet dress
across the floor to the window.</p>

<p>She drew back a fold of the lace curtain and peered
through the window-pane and the closed shutters into the
street.</p>

<p>The short, wintery afternoon was darkening into twilight,
and the sky was obscured by dark, heavy clouds.
The proud, imperious beauty leaned her brow against the
cold pane, trying to solve the problem that tormented her
mind.</p>

<p>"I must get rid of her somehow. She dimly suspects
treachery on my part. If she goes out of the house again
she will prosecute her search and learn all," she thought.
"Ah, I have a plan! If I could only detain her here long
enough to have that doctor come and take her to the
<i>maison de sant</i> where mamma is, she would never get
out again!"</p>

<p>She turned swiftly, crossed the room to Flower, and sat
down by her side on the sofa, placing her white arm
around her sister's neck.</p>

<p>"My poor little sister, forgive me my harshness," she
whispered, penitently.</p>

<p>The drooping, despondent girl started and looked up.
That Judas face was wreathed in a loving smile that bewildered
her. Never had she caught such a look on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
half-sister's face since their early happy days ere Laurie
Meredith's love had come between their hearts.</p>

<p>"Jewel!" she exclaimed, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Darling Flower!" answered the other, and clasped her
victim in a loving embrace, whispering, fondly:</p>

<p>"You see how the old love comes back, dear, in spite
of all my efforts to be your enemy. After all, we are half-sisters.
Nothing can alter that, just as nothing can
wholly change our love that was so sweet and strong when
we believed ourselves twins. I forgive you all, for&mdash;listen"&mdash;and
she pressed her lips to Flower's cold cheek&mdash;"I
loved him, too, you know, and if he had fancied me I
might have been his victim instead of you."</p>

<p>Flower clung to her, weeping, all her resentment and
suspicion melted before this specious show of solicitude
and affection.</p>

<p>"And," continued Jewel, "I want you to stay with me
always, Flower, and share my home and my wealth. You
must take off these shabby clothes that," playfully,
"looks as if they belonged to somebody's servant. Marie
shall bring you one of my prettiest tea-gowns, and when
we have had some tea you shall tell me where you have
been all this while, the reason you ran away that night,
and what became of your little child."</p>

<p>As if those words touched a subtle cord of memory,
Flower flung off the arm that clasped her with sinuous
softness, like a serpent's fold, and cried out, in a terrified
voice:</p>

<p>"Not now, Jewel, for I have stayed too long already.
I shall be missed; my&mdash;they will be alarmed at my long
absence. I must go now, dear sister, but I&mdash;I will come
again, or&mdash;I will write."</p>

<p>She rushed toward the door, but Jewel clung to her
tightly, entreating her to stay.</p>

<p>"This is your home, your rightful home," she cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
desperately. "It is too dark and cold for you to go out
now! At least stay to-night, and in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>She never finished the sentence, for Flower interrupted
her, protesting that she could not, would not, must not
stay. She would come again, but her mistress expected
her now.</p>

<p>Jewel's arms began to tighten obstinately about Flower,
and then, frightened and panting, the girl began to struggle
frantically to get away.</p>

<p>It all passed in a minute. Jewel saw that her victim
would escape her, for her frantic struggles began to tell,
and she was dragging her foe with her toward the door.
There was a marble-topped stand in their way, littered with
costly trifles of bric--brac. Jewel flung out one hand,
caught up something, she knew not what, and brought it
down heavily on the golden head from which the close
bonnet had fallen in the struggle.</p>

<p>There was one low, stifled moan, one only, then the
struggling form relaxed its rigidity, the outstretched arms
fell heavily, and in a minute more Jewel was standing
still, looking at something lying very white and still upon
the floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel stood like one rooted to the floor gazing at her
terrible work, for to all appearance life had fled from her
hapless victim.</p>

<p>Flower lay like one dead upon the velvet carpet, her
eyes half closed, her face ashen, and the missile with
which Jewel had struck her, a small bronze toy, had
glanced aside after doing its deadly work and fallen several
feet away.</p>

<p>Jewel's dark face grew pale, too, and she shuddered
with horror of the deed she had done.</p>

<p>In a minute she flung herself down upon her knees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
felt for her sister's heart, but no pulse stirred the white
breast of the prostrate girl.</p>

<p>"Before Heaven, I did not mean to do this!" Jewel
muttered. "I only meant to stun her that she might not
get away. I did not mean to kill her, but she is dead, and
I am a terrible sinner in the sight of God!"</p>

<p>For a minute she felt shocked and remorseful, and
longed to bring Flower back to life; but then that momentary
mood was succeeded by the bitter jealous one of
a little while ago, and a half-ashamed exultation crept
into her heart.</p>

<p>"After all," whispered her evil genius, "it is better
that it happened thus. She is out of your way now, and
you can marry Laurie Meredith without fearing that she
may turn up at any minute to take him from you. Rejoice,
heart, that your rival is no more!"</p>

<p>After that she thought of nothing but the relief she
would feel hereafter in knowing that Flower was really
dead, and of hiding her dead body where no one could
ever find it.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' reflection she thought of the old
cellar under the house. Doubtless it was several feet under
water now, owing to the snow of last week and the
subsequent thaw.</p>

<p>"If I could throw her in there I should be safe!" she
muttered.</p>

<p>She hardly knew how she accomplished it, but she
dragged Flower's body down to the cellar and pushed it
inside the door. It fell with a loud splash into the water,
and Jewel banged the door to wildly, and rushed from the
scene of her awful crime.</p>

<p>She did not know whether it was minutes or hours that
she lay shuddering upon the sofa before Marie entered and
looked around with a disappointed expression.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I did not like to disturb you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the la&mdash;woman, mademoiselle, but it is quite time that
you decided on what flowers you will wear this evening."</p>

<p>Jewel lifted her blanched face from the sofa, and said,
carelessly:</p>

<p>"The flowers? use your own taste, Marie. It is always
perfect. As for disturbing me&mdash;why, the woman went
long ago, poor beggar. She had seen better days, she
said, but she was a widow now with two children freezing
in a garret. I gave her five dollars to buy food and coal,
then I rang the bell for you to show her out. But you did
not answer, so, as she was in a hurry to get back to her
little ones, I showed her out myself."</p>

<p>Marie murmured some glib phrases of admiration for
her young lady's condescension, then begged pardon for
being in the conservatory and out of sound of the bell.</p>

<p>"I just ran down to see about the flowers for your corsage,
but everything was so sweet and fragrant I couldn't
tear myself away," she explained, with many nods and
shrugs of head and shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are very excusable," Jewel replied, drawing a
long breath of relief at hearing that Marie had been in
the conservatory, out of reach of what had happened awhile
ago.</p>

<p>She had feared at first that she would have to take the
clever maid into her confidence and secure her aid in removing
the body, but now she was very glad she had not
done so.</p>

<p>"I accomplished it all by myself, although I ran a terrible
risk in doing so. Ugh! what if Mrs. Wellings, or
any of the servants, had come upon me when I was dragging
her through the halls and down the stairs!" she
shuddered to herself, with a passing wonder at her own
hardihood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>No one who saw Jewel Fielding at Mrs. Devere's splendid
reception that night would have guessed the dark
secret she had in her breast.</p>

<p>The purple plush and brocade, with the diamond ornaments
and creamy-hued corsage flowers, made her beauty
seem queenly. Her dark eyes radiated light enough to
atone for the slight pallor of her cheeks, whereon the rose
was wont to bloom, and her lips were wreathed in deceptive
smiles that hid the horror lurking in her heart.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith thought that he had never seen her
more beautiful than to-night, and he did not wonder that
she had so many admirers. The only thing that surprised
him was that she could prefer himself above all
those others who worshiped her, while he had been one of
the most indifferent suitors that ever bowed at woman's
shrine.</p>

<p>But her beauty and her devotion had touched his heart
at last. He must have been a marble man if it had not,
for her devotion was so plain, and yet so pathetic, seeming
to ask for nothing in return save the privilege of loving.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Only to love him&mdash;nothing more,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Never a thought of his loving me!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Proud of him, glad of him, though he bore<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My heart to shipwreck on this smooth sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Love's faith sees only grief, not wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And life is daring when 'tis young."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If anything could have excused her folly and sin it
would have been the madness of her passion for him. She
worshiped him and made no secret of it. She could not
keep her dark eyes from turning to his face, even in the
greatest crowds; she could not keep from speaking to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
if he came near her. By degrees the little world of society
realized this. People would smile when they saw them
together. They would take care not to intrude on their
<i>tte--ttes</i>, not knowing that the love was all on one side.</p>

<p>The Merediths could not help but see how things were
going. Indeed, they had seen long ago that she was in
love with Laurie, and had been ever since that summer
when she had nursed him through the brain fever. They
talked to him delicately about it, wondering how he could
remain so indifferent to one so beautiful and loving.</p>

<p>With so many influences brought to bear upon him, he
began to wonder at himself. Why could he not care for
this beautiful girl who was so unhappy about him? for he
remembered that she had loved him long ago&mdash;when, in
her girlish anger and jealousy, she had said:</p>

<p>"You have made love to my sister, and you have made
love to me; you have won both our hearts. Now choose
between us!"</p>

<p>She was older and more cultured now&mdash;perhaps ashamed
of her early madness&mdash;yet the love was there still. Had
he indeed encouraged it only to nip the fair flower in the
bud?</p>

<p>He remembered that he certainly had admired her very
much&mdash;had even cherished some romantic thoughts about
making her his bride, until sweet Flower put it all out of
his head. The thought came to him for the first time,
that perhaps there had been some justice in her charge.
She had been so young, so unversed in the ways of the
world, that a few gallant words and admiring glances had
wiled her heart from her forever.</p>

<p>Flower was dead and gone&mdash;why could he not tear his
heart from his perished love and give it to her unhappy
sister? It seemed to him that Flower&mdash;dear, gentle girl&mdash;herself
would have wished it.</p>

<p>"Pity is akin to love," it is said. He began to feel
very sorry for Jewel, who, with all her gifts of youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
beauty, and wealth, was so unutterably lonely, and so
unhappy through her hopeless love. The moment came
when this sympathy, combined with admiration for her
beauty, led him into the belief that he loved her at last.</p>

<p>He proposed for her hand, and was accepted with a
rapture that almost startled him with its intensity. To-night,
as he lingered by her side, he felt proud of his
fiance, so beautiful and so loving. He smiled into her
eyes, and thought within himself that the day would come
when he would be almost as fond of her as he had been of
Flower.</p>

<p>They were sitting <i>tte--tte</i> on a velvet couch in the
long drawing-room, when their hostess approached, and
asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Have either of you seen Lord Ivon's heiress, the great
English beauty? She is here to-night, and people are raving
over her loveliness. But you need not be afraid of a
rival, Miss Fielding, as her type is the opposite of your
own. I do not praise one of my own sex often," laughingly;
"but I will own that she is, as the poet laureate of
her own land aptly says, 'Perfectly beautiful, faultily
faultless.'"</p>

<p>"Indeed? I am very anxious to see her!" exclaimed
Jewel, with a half sneer; but Laurie Meredith only
laughed. He thought he had seen so many English beauties
while abroad; and, after all, none could compare, in
his own mind, with the lovely women of his native land.
"Where is she, Mrs. Devere?" continued Jewel, angrily,
eager to look upon one of whom she was furiously jealous,
only because report said that she was wondrously lovely.</p>

<p>"If you will come with me I will present you. I am
curious to see the meeting between the loveliest girl in
America and the greatest beauty in England!" exclaimed
Mrs. Devere, who doted on beauty because she was irredeemably
homely herself.</p>

<p>Jewel was mollified by the compliment, and smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
brightly on her hostess and her lover as she rose from her
seat.</p>

<p>"Will you come, too, Laurie?" she asked; but he
shook his handsome head.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for the present," he replied; and Jewel
went away with Mrs. Devere, secretly glad that her lover
showed so little interest in the beauty over whom every
one was raving.</p>

<p>"And I have been so afraid of her&mdash;so foolishly jealous!"
she thought, gladly, all her fears set at rest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Laurie Meredith leaned his handsome head carelessly
back, and the smile that he had worn for Jewel's sake
faded away and left his face grave and sober, as it had
grown to be since that summer when he had gone away
from the sea-shore, leaving his little love behind him because
she had changed her mind almost at the last moment
and declined to go with her lover-husband.</p>

<p>His tender thoughts of the dead girl were always mixed
with pain and remorse, for he believed that Flower's love
for him had been less strong than he had believed it at first.
Her refusal to go away with him, and her subsequent
short and strange letters, led him to this belief.</p>

<p>"She was little more than a child, and it was a girlish
fancy that she took for love," he thought now. "It was
cruel in me to take advantage of her, and bind her by a
tie that afterward made her miserable. Jewel may say
what she pleases, but I am not sure that Flower drowned
herself wholly on account of the unhappy circumstances
of her birth. I fear that her sorrow over her hasty marriage,
and despair at her situation, helped to drive her to
that mad deed."</p>

<p>At times he could not help contrasting the fickleness of
Flower's love with the constancy and devotion of Jewel's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
He had said to himself more than once, with a pang of
wounded pride:</p>

<p>"Flower cared but little for my love, but Jewel valued
it above all else on earth. It is right that I should reward
her devotion. I will try to love the faithful, dark-eyed
girl as she deserves."</p>

<p>But such is the strangeness of the human heart that he
prized the memory of the lost girl far more than he did
the living love of beautiful, passionate Jewel. He could
not have helped it if he would, and he did not struggle
much against the feeling, for it seemed to him that he
owed his greatest allegiance to the memory of her who had
loved him, for a time at least, tenderly and truly, and
who had died so young; and to his heart there came sometimes,
with a shuddering pain, the strangely fitting words
of Poe, the passionate poet, who sounded the heights and
depths of love's emotion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Would to God I could awaken!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For I dream I know not how,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my soul is sorely shaken<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest an evil step be taken&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest the dead who is forsaken<br /></span>
<span class="i3">May not be happy now!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Almost without his own volition, and perhaps partly inspired
by the strain of half-sad music that floated out
from the ball-room, these often-recurring thoughts came
to him again, and, wrapped in their pain and pathos, he
forgot the flight of time until he saw Jewel coming back
to him alone, with such a pale, drawn face that he started
in wonder.</p>

<p>"My dear, what is it? You look as if you had seen a
ghost!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She fell wearily into the seat by his side, and answered,
in a low, strained voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, Laurie, I have had a great shock!"</p>

<p>He could well believe her, for she was trembling violently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
her face, and even her lips were ghastly pale, and her
eyes had a startled expression in their dark, liquid depths.</p>

<p>No one was near, and he took her hand and pressed it
gently, murmuring something suitable to the occasion in
his tender solicitude.</p>

<p>He was rewarded by a faint, sweet smile and look of
adoration from her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will think me foolish," she said&mdash;"perhaps
you will not see any resemblance at all. It was only
that both had the same eyes and hair; but I was so
startled! I&mdash;I feared you would be shocked, too, so I
hurried back to tell you&mdash;to warn you!"</p>

<p>"Jewel, whom are you talking about? I do not understand
you," her lover said, with a gleam of wonder in his
grave, brown eyes.</p>

<p>She answered with a palpable reluctance, yet as if compelled
to the confession:</p>

<p>"Of Miss Brooke, the English beauty. She is very
beautiful&mdash;a blonde, with the brightest golden hair, and
eyes with the purple-blue of wet violets. And, oh, Laurie,
she looked so much like&mdash;like Flower, that I was frightened.
But," growing braver, "of course, there was nothing
in it to frighten me, only I was taken by surprise.
There are plenty of striking resemblances in the world."</p>

<p>Her jealous eyes saw his handsome face whiten with
emotion.</p>

<p>He said, in a strange, agitated voice:</p>

<p>"Why do you say there could be nothing in it? No
one could be quite sure that Flower drowned herself. It
was only suspicion. No one saw her commit suicide.
And her body was never recovered."</p>

<p>"Oh, Laurie, what nonsense! I told you she had vowed
to drown herself, that I watched her all the time to prevent
her from carrying out her threat; but that night
when she got away, I went immediately to the shore, and
there I found her shawl. What further proof could one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
need after what she had threatened so often? Besides, she
was never seen nor heard of afterward. Some one must
have heard of her if she had not been dead!"</p>

<p>"There was that strange dream of the mulatto, Sam,
you know," he answered.</p>

<p>"Sam&mdash;a drunken fool!" said Jewel, with compressed
lips and flashing eyes. "His wife denied every word of
it. She was a clever, truthful woman."</p>

<p>He sighed and relapsed into silence while she continued,
with feverish eagerness:</p>

<p>"Of course, I know that Flower is dead! I have never
doubted it with the evidence that I had. But, in spite of
all, it gave me a shock to see Azalia Brooke. I feared you
might be startled, too, and betray some agitation on meeting
her, so I hurried back to warn you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, dear Jewel," he said, affecting indifference.
"I dare say the resemblance is not very striking.
I promise you to meet the English beauty with due
calmness."</p>

<p>"Dear Laurie," she whispered, fondly, and twined her
jeweled fingers softly about his. "Do you know," she
went on, smilingly, "I was actually feeling jealous of
Azalia Brooke? I thought&mdash;since she looked so much like
Flower&mdash;that she might win you from me!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he replied, with a smile, that lightened
her heart of much of its fear, and gave her courage to say,
tenderly:</p>

<p>"Promise me, dear Laurie, not to fall in love with
Azalia Brooke, for you know that would break my heart.
Once before, when I fondly dreamed that you were mine
alone, I lost you to another, and I could not bear that
cruel pain again and live!"</p>

<p>His heart was deeply touched by her devotion.</p>

<p>"Jewel, I am not worthy of such passionate love," he
said, feeling that his lukewarm passion compared most
unfavorably with her fond affection. Then seeing how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
anxious she looked, he added, "I will promise you most
willingly not to fall in love with Miss Brooke."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I will not take you away at once, as I
was on the point of doing in my terror of a rival," she rejoined,
laughingly, yet hoping that he would offer to go.</p>

<p>But he did not do so. A secret longing to see Azalia
Brooke took possession of him&mdash;a longing that he was wise
enough not to confess to jealous Jewel.</p>

<p>"Let us go into the conservatory," she said, longing to
rest awhile in its leafy, odorous coolness, that she might
settle her disordered nerves, and he gave her his arm and
led her toward that favorite resort of lovers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Young flowers were whispering in melody<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To happy flowers that night&mdash;and tree to tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fountains were gushing music as they fell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In that enchanted spot Jewel thought she should have
him all to herself, for she had left Azalia Brooke in the
ball-room surrounded by eager admirers, but what was
her surprise to see, just ahead of her, with a handsome
young man, the beautiful English girl talking so earnestly
that she did not hear nor see the new-comers at all.</p>

<p>If Azalia Brooke could have been permitted to decide
under what circumstances she should be seen first by
Laurie Meredith, she could not have chosen a more striking
moment than the present.</p>

<p>She had paused with her attendant cavalier beside a
perfect thicket of her namesake flowers&mdash;red and white
azalias. A fountain and some lofty palm-trees were in
the background, and made a lovely setting for her face
and dress.</p>

<p>The former we have described before in all its wondrous
beauty; the latter was an exquisite robe of silvery white
moir antique, draped in billows of white tulle, looped
crystallized sea-grasses and water-lilies. The perfect
throat and arms were clasped with large pearls, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
golden waves of hair were banded back with a Grecian
fillet of the same pure jewels. It was a trying costume;
but the blue of her eyes was so deep, the sheen of her
hair so goldenly bright, and the rose-hue so warm on her
delicate cheek, that the unbroken white and green were
perfectly relieved, and set off her charms to the greatest
advantage.</p>

<p>Her companion was talking to her earnestly, and she
was listening to him with an absent smile, when Laurie
Meredith first caught sight of her face.</p>

<p>He stopped short. Jewel felt him start and tremble.
She glanced into his face and saw it pale, startled, eager.
A low whisper came from his lips, and her keen ear
caught the burden. It was the one word:</p>

<p>"Flower!"</p>

<p>They were only a few yards away from the couple.
Jewel pinched his arm, warningly.</p>

<p>"Laurie!"</p>

<p>He withdrew his eyes with difficulty from Azalia's face,
and he looked down at his betrothed.</p>

<p>"Do not stare so," she whispered, uneasily. "I
warned you of the likeness, you know."</p>

<p>With a heavy sigh he came back to himself.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, confusedly, and moved on.</p>

<p>A meeting was inevitable now. Laurie Meredith and
Azalia Brooke were face to face.</p>

<p>Jewel's voice was uttering, not overcordially, the words
of introduction.</p>

<p>Both bowed and murmured something almost inaudible,
then Jewel drew her lover on with her to a quiet spot,
leaving the couple alone.</p>

<p>That was but the beginning. They met night after
night in the saloons of fashion, although Jewel contrived
to keep them apart, they studied each other closely,
and both were startled by the other's likeness to a dead
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Jewel was puzzled, too, by the terrible resemblance of
Azalia Brooke to her dead half-sister.</p>

<p>"If I did not know that she was dead, if I did not
know what was lying in that old cellar under the noisome
water, ay, if I did not know whose ghost it was that
haunted the corridors of that old house, I could almost
swear that this was Flower masquerading under a grand
seeming," she told herself over and over, with a shudder;
for Jewel's life had the stain of a dark sin on it now, and
she had seen more than once or twice the vision of a
light, shadowy figure all in luminous white, with floating
golden hair, flitting at twilight through the corridors of
her stately home.</p>

<p>"It is Flower's spirit!" she decided, fearfully, and wondered
if the murdered girl were going to haunt her all her
life.</p>

<p>"Oh, how much I have done for the sake of my love
for Laurie Meredith!" she thought. "And yet, I half
believe that but for dread of me he would woo this hateful
English girl only for the sake of that fatal resemblance.
He is attracted toward her. I can see that in spite
of the indifference he pretends. Let him beware! Let
both beware, for if they played me false both should answer
with their lives!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>


<p>Azalia Brooke went home that night from the grand
ball, puzzled, tormented, almost convinced that her lover-husband
was not dead, but that he lived in the person of
Jewel Fielding's lover.</p>

<p>His striking likeness to him she had so long believed
dead was so wonderful and startling that it had almost
unnerved her that night, and it was only by a strong exercise
of will-power that she resisted the impulse to cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
out, to claim him, and charge him with his falsity, to say,
bitterly:</p>

<p>"It was not you that died, Laurie Meredith. That was
a clever sham, like your marriage with me. You were
false to the core of your heart, and perhaps combined with
my cruel sister to get rid of me."</p>

<p>Wounded pride, bitter resentment, and a terror of being
thrown helpless on the world, held her back from betraying
herself to him who would have welcomed her so
gladly.</p>

<p>It was pitiful for those two who had loved so well, who
had been all the world to each other, whose hearts still
held each other's image, to meet as mere strangers, to
speak coldly to each other, yet a cruel fate, in the person
of Jewel Fielding, had willed it so, and they moved and
acted like mere puppets under her merciless hands.</p>

<p>"He did not even remember me. He betrayed not the
slightest emotion on meeting me, while I&mdash;I was trembling
with excitement. If indeed it be the Laurie of old
he soon tired of me, and then forgot me utterly, so that
after a few years he can meet me with a glance of a
stranger," she thought, bitterly; and pride came to her
aid to uphold her in the task of meeting indifference with
indifference.</p>

<p>"Yet I would give the world to find out if it is really
Laurie, or only a relative with a startling resemblance,"
she thought many times.</p>

<p>As they met so often in society, this longing grew upon
her, but she could find no means of gratifying it, for she
could not ask any one else about it, and Jewel was so jealous
over her lover that she kept him chained like a slave
to her triumphal car.</p>

<p>But one afternoon they met at a kettle-drum&mdash;a species
of informal entertainments then raging in society. The
gentlemen came in their ordinary dress, the ladies in calling
or simple walking costume. Chance threw Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Meredith and Azalia Brooke together in a cozy corner,
with their cups of tea.</p>

<p>Jewel? She was <i>tte--tte</i> with a distinguished gentleman,
from whom she could not escape just now with
strict courtesy. She listened with a forced smile to his
fluent periods, and furtively watched the pair over yonder,
coquetting, as she said angrily to herself, over their
fragrant cups of tea and thin cakes.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke's exquisite beauty appeared to advantage
in a close-fitting tailor suit of broadcloth. A plumed turban
of the same becoming hue set off her rippling golden
hair.</p>

<p>She said to her companion, with a fast-beating heart:</p>

<p>"Miss Fielding has told me, Mr. Meredith, that you
were abroad two years. Of course you visited England.
Did you see Cornwall? My home is there. It is quite a
show-place, being very ancient, and having a magnificent
picture-gallery."</p>

<p>He said audaciously that he had been in England, and
should have gone down to Cornwall to see Lord Ivon's
pictures if he could have believed that there was anything
on canvas there half as lovely as herself.</p>

<p>Miss Brooke shook her spoon at him in playful reproof,
and he continued:</p>

<p>"I spent most of my time, however, at a German university."</p>

<p>Azalia gave an uncontrollable start that jarred the cup
in her hand and made the tea splash over a little on her
lap.</p>

<p>"How awkward I am!" she said, laughing. "Ah!
and so you were a German student, Mr. Meredith?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for a time," he replied. "Not that I cared
much for it, but my father was so anxious for it before his
death that I went afterward, just because he had wished it&mdash;not
that I benefited much by it, I fear. My thoughts
were full of other things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Azalia swallowed her tea at a draught in order not to
spill any more on her dress. She looked at him then, and
said:</p>

<p>"So your father is dead? That is sad. Mine died
when I was a very tiny baby. I have often wished that
he had lived that I might have known the pleasure of a
father's love and care."</p>

<p>Her voice was low with regret and pain. His soul
stirred with sympathy.</p>

<p>"You have much to regret in losing your father so
soon," he said. "I can not tell you what mine was to
me, what a mentor, what a friend, until his death nearly
three years ago."</p>

<p>"Three years!" she echoed, faintly, and the pretty eggshell
china tea-cup fell from her hands to the carpet,
crashing into a dozen fragments.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how very careless I am!" she exclaimed,
dismayed at the attention she attracted by her accident.
She saw Jewel looking at her with jealous suspicion, but
took no notice, and as a servant appeared to remove the
<i>dbris</i>, she turned smilingly back to her companion and
said, lightly:</p>

<p>"Everything slips through my fingers," and added,
miserably, to herself, "Love and happiness with the
rest!"</p>

<p>He was about to reply with some admiring sentence,
when he saw Jewel coming over to them with a bright
smile that was assumed to veil her jealous spite.</p>

<p>"Laurie, what did you say to Miss Brooke to shock her
into breaking her tea-cup?" playfully.</p>

<p>He answered, as he rose to place a chair for her:</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Azalia Brooke looked up at her with artless cordiality.</p>

<p>"Was it not dreadful, spoiling Mrs. Stanley's beautiful
set that way? Won't you go with me to-morrow, Miss
Fielding, and try to match it?" she asked. "Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
know, I was so interested in what Mr. Meredith was telling,
I forgot I had it in my hand, and it fell. It seems he
has been a student at one of those delightful German universities.
He was telling me how much his father wished
it before his death, nearly three years ago."</p>

<p>Was there a strange, hidden meaning in the blue eyes
that met Jewel's? Was there a menace in the distinct
voice? Jewel quailed for a moment, fancying these
things, and her rival saw her turn pale and tremble.</p>

<p>But it was Jewel's turn now.</p>

<p>"Laurie, will you take me home now? I have another
engagement," she said.</p>

<p>They bowed and went away from the presence of the
young beauty.</p>

<p>On the way home Jewel betrayed her petulant jealousy
plainly.</p>

<p>"You promised me not to fall in love with that girl,
Laurie."</p>

<p>"Did your 'other engagement' mean that you wanted
to bring me away to scold me?" he asked, frowning.</p>

<p>"You are in love with her, Laurie!" angrily.</p>

<p>"You are jealous," he retorted; and Jewel took refuge
in tears, while her betrothed relapsed into offended silence.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Jewel realized that she was going too far,
begged his pardon for her folly, and riveted her chains
more firmly than ever.</p>

<p>They parted affectionately, and when he had gone, she
muttered:</p>

<p>"Could she have escaped? I must satisfy myself, much
as I dread it, for to-night I could have sworn that Flower's
voice spoke to me with a hidden threat in its tone.
Oh, I wish I were safely married and away on my bridal-tour!"</p>

<p>She crept to the door of the deserted cellar, unclosed it,
peered into the darkness with dilated eyes. She heard
great rats plunging about, saw the noisome water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
standing, green and stagnant, several feet deep, and a
large blank water-proof cloak floating on the top.</p>

<p>"She is there still. It was my guilty fancy that made
me clothe Azalia Brooke with Flower's soul!" she shuddered,
as she fled back to her room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, Azalia Brooke had pleaded another engagement,
too, and returned home.</p>

<p>She flung herself upon the floor, sobbing miserably:</p>

<p>"It is he, my own darling; but Jewel has taken him
from me. It was his father's death she showed me in the
paper. Perhaps they planned it together, thinking that
the shock would kill me."</p>

<p>Then she lay for some time, still and unconscious.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Laurie Meredith found himself in a terrible dilemma.
He had thought that he was quite safe in pledging himself
to Jewel Fielding, being perfectly sure that he could
never love again as he had loved his lost Flower.</p>

<p>But suddenly, and almost hopelessly, it seemed, he
found himself most passionately in love with Lord Ivon's
great-granddaughter, the proud English beauty.</p>

<p>And it was her wonderful resemblance to Flower that
had wiled his heart from his breast.</p>

<p>At times, when looking at her or listening to her musical
voice, he could scarcely persuade himself that she
was a stranger; she seemed so much like Flower, his lost
bride, that he longed to clasp her in his arms, and say:</p>

<p>"You must be Flower, who loved me so dearly once,
and who was my adored little bride! Confess the truth,
and own that you are only masquerading as the heiress of
this proud nobleman!"</p>

<p>If he had followed this wild impulse of his heart all
would have been well. She would have been only too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
happy to find him again, and would gladly have resigned
the proudest destiny for his dear sake.</p>

<p>But his reason fought sternly against such folly and
madness. He would say to himself, in bitter chiding:</p>

<p>"I am a traitor to Jewel in thus cherishing a mad passion
for one whom she instinctively dreaded from the first
as a rival. Flower is dead, dead; and this girl, with her
face and voice, is but a stranger. Oh, my little love, my
blue-eyed Flower, if only I could call you back to my
heart!"</p>

<p>His passionate regret for her revived with tenfold force;
she seemed to be always in his mind, mixed up strangely
with the idea of Azalia Brooke, and people began to say
that he had forgotten all the songs he ever knew but one,
for when pressed to sing of late he always gave the same
song&mdash;one that particularly irritated Jewel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou art lost to me forever&mdash;I have lost thee, Isadore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy head will never rest on my loyal bosom more,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy tender eyes will never more gaze fondly into mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor thy arm around me lovingly and trustingly intwine.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My footsteps through the rooms resound all sadly and forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mocking-bird still sits and sings a melancholy strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For my heart is like a heavy cloud that overflows with rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Within a week after that scene in which Jewel had betrayed
her angry jealousy of Azalia Brooke, he wished devoutly
that he had never entangled himself in an engagement
with the imperious brunette.</p>

<p>Could he have followed the dictates of his heart he
would not have lost an hour in wooing Azalia Brooke.</p>

<p>She had told him that she was going soon. They had
been in Boston more than a month, and Lord and Lady
Ivon were getting anxious to resume their travels. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
would go to Washington next to see an American Congress
in session, and an American President.</p>

<p>When he heard that she was going, he realized, by the
terrible pain he felt, that he loved her with his whole
soul, that when she was gone, the whole world would seem
dark and cold and empty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For, alas, alas! with me<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The light of life is o'er!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'No more&mdash;no more&mdash;no more&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i3">(Such language holds the solemn sea<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the sands upon the shore)<br /></span>

<span class="i1">In what ethereal dances,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By what eternal streams!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He grew impatient with himself at what he called to
himself his inexcusable folly. What if he were free to
woo, was it likely she would listen?&mdash;she, the proud descendant
of one of the proudest lords of England. Doubtless
she had been taught to have a secret contempt for
Americans, and he was a thorough American, proud of
his country, proud of its institutions, and though rich,
cultured, and well-born, he had no title to lay at the
beauty's feet, while Mrs. Raynold Clinton had told him
that the young and handsome Earl of Clive was desperately
in love with Azalia Brooke.</p>

<p>"He was like her shadow in London last winter," she
said. "Azalia refused him, but he would not take no for
an answer, and Lord and Lady Ivon are in hopes she will
reconsider her decision, as the match is a good one, even
for their great-granddaughter."</p>

<p>Every word was a thorn in his heart. He began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
realize something of what Jewel's jealousy was to her in
the strange pain that racked his heart.</p>

<p>Then he tried to reason with himself. He never could
be anything to Azalia Brooke, even if she were not so cold
and proud. He belonged to Jewel Fielding, and she had
made him understand very plainly that it would not be a
safe plan for him to break with her now.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Earl of Clive made his appearance in Boston.
He had crossed the Atlantic in order to be near the
lady of his heart.</p>

<p>He was young, rich, and good-looking&mdash;a trifle arrogant,
perhaps, but one with so many gifts of this life has
some cause for vanity.</p>

<p>He devoted himself with ardor to Azalia Brooke, causing
more than one gallant admirer to think, indignantly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Were there no beauteous maids at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And no true lovers here,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That he must cross the seas to win<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The dearest of the dear?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jewel Fielding was very glad that Azalia Brooke's titled
lover had come upon the scene.</p>

<p>The beautiful brunette was by no means blind to the
state of her lover's feelings. She was half maddened with
her bitter jealousy of her betrothed and her hatred of
Azalia Brooke.</p>

<p>She hoped that Laurie would see the futility of his passion
now that Lord Clive had come.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel was very busy getting ready for her marriage
now, which had been set for the early spring. In her
anxiety to be sure of her husband she would have liked to
forego the delights of a trousseau, and be married at once,
but she had no excuse for hurrying the time, and Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Meredith never hinted at the intervening months as being
at all too long.</p>

<p>So Jewel filled up her life as much as possible with
ordering an expensive trousseau and mixing in the gay
world, not giving herself time to think, for "that way
madness lay."</p>

<p>One evening her lover had called to accompany her to
an entertainment given in honor of Lord and Lady Ivon,
who were to leave on the morrow. Jewel was exquisitely
dressed for the occasion in a dress of dark-red satin,
draped in rich black lace, one of her favorite and most
becoming costumes. Her ornaments were deep red rubies
set in gold.</p>

<p>A happy light was burning in the large dark eyes, for
her rival was going away to-morrow, never to cross her
path in life again, she hoped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wellings, in rich black velvet and point lace, was
in attendance as chaperon.</p>

<p>Jewel slipped her gloved hand through the arm of her
betrothed.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the conservatory, dear Laurie," she
whispered, fondly. "I have a fancy that you shall choose
the flowers I wear to-night."</p>

<p>He rose with her and selected deep-red jacqueminot
roses. She made him cut them off with long stems and
an abundance of buds, and was about to fasten them in
her corsage, when, to his utter amazement, she uttered a
wild, startled shriek, dropped the flowers and fell against
his breast, clasping her white arms around his neck.</p>

<p>"Jewel, what is it?" he exclaimed, putting his arm
around her gently, and looking down at her convulsed
face.</p>

<p>He saw that her eyes were fixed upon a door in the rear
end of the conservatory, and his glance hastily followed
her strained and startled one.</p>

<p>As he did so, a blast of keen, cold, wintery air swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
through the warm, odorous conservatory. The rear door
was open, and upon its threshold, very clearly outlined
against the blackness of the outer night, there was standing
a slight, girlish figure all in white.</p>

<p>A swift shudder crept along the veins of Laurie Meredith.</p>

<p>The figure he was gazing at was all in misty, yet luminous
white, that fell from neck to feet in a loose, graceful
fashion. The face was not quite clear in the dim light,
but it seemed to be of mortal paleness, while all around it
fell long waves of golden hair.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith gazed in wonder and awe at that
strange, unearthly looking figure, while Jewel shuddered
and moaned, faintly:</p>

<p>"You see it, do you not, Laurie&mdash;the awful spirit form?
Oh, this old house is haunted! I have seen the ghosts
more than once, but I would not speak lest no one would
believe me. But, oh, you can not guess what I have suffered,
and, dear, I shall be so glad when I am married
and gone from this dismal, haunted abode!"</p>

<p>Jewel had seen the ghost so often that her nerves were
steeled against it, and she turned it to account by this
clever hint to Laurie to hasten their marriage.</p>

<p>Both were looking intently at the luminous figure in the
open door. It moved slightly and threw up one arm in a
theatrical gesture, and Laurie Meredith uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>"A ghost, Jewel! But I do not believe in ghosts!"</p>

<p>"Nor did I, till I came to this horrible house!" she whispered.
"Oh, Laurie, what are you going to do?" for he
had drawn her arms from his neck and was pushing her
hurriedly into a chair.</p>

<p>"I shall speak to the ghost," he whispered, and darted
down the flowery vista.</p>

<p>There was a stifled shriek, a flutter of garments. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ghost fled into the outer darkness, and Laurie Meredith
after it.</p>

<p>Jewel sat quaking in her chair, thinking in terror:</p>

<p>"Ah, what if it should lead him into the old cellar, and
he should discover my awful secret?"</p>

<p>At that moment a woman's shrill, frightened cry became
audible, a moment later the voice of a man:</p>

<p>"Who are you, playing ghost like this, and frightening
helpless women out of their senses? You need not struggle,
for I am going to unmask you."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>The pretty ghost was quite strong. It struggled desperately
out there in the darkness, but it was no match
for Laurie Meredith, and presently he dragged it triumphantly
into the conservatory, and tore from it a wig of fair
hair and a white complexion mask. This revealed the
pretty, flustered face of Jewel's maid, who, in a spangled
tarletan dress and wig and mask, had made an ethereal-looking
ghost.</p>

<p>"Marie!" exclaimed Jewel, in astonishment and relief.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, ma'amselle</i>," replied the pretty maid, with a
titter.</p>

<p>"So you recognize the ghost?" Laurie demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jewel. "Oh, Marie, was it you all the
time?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, mademoiselle, but&mdash;yes. I&mdash;I&mdash;did not mean
to frighten any one, only to tease Jules, the gardener, who
is my lover."</p>

<p>"It was a very poor joke. If I were in your place,
Jewel, I would dismiss this girl from my employ at
once," Laurie Meredith said, sternly.</p>

<p>Marie whimpered, and looked pleadingly at Jewel, who
hardened her heart, and said, severely:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you may go. You are a mischievous girl, and
have given me several frights that I shall never forget."</p>

<p>A strange smile flickered over the girl's face, but she
said, humbly:</p>

<p>"I will never do it again&mdash;only let me stay, ma'amselle!"</p>

<p>"No, you shall not stay. I discharge you, and without
a character," replied Jewel, angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh, mademoiselle, you are cruel. Grant me but a
private interview, and I will convince you that I am not
to blame," pleaded Marie, humbly; but her eloquence
would have had no effect on Jewel but for an expression
that appeared in the girl's eyes and startled her into yielding,
it was so full of bold meaning and deadly menace.</p>

<p>The glance made Jewel quake, she could not tell why,
only that her consciousness of a dark and guilty secret
made her nervous and fearful. She hesitated a moment,
and the girl, turning her back completely on Laurie,
made large eyes of such impudent menace at her that she
was compelled to acquiesce.</p>

<p>She looked at her betrothed, and said, sweetly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better hear her defense, Laurie. I do
not wish to be too hard on a poor, friendless girl."</p>

<p>"That is very magnanimous of you, Jewel," he replied,
admiringly. "Do as you please, only let our young
friend here understand that at another such offense she
must go."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I will never do so again!" whimpered Marie
again; and she dropped into a mocking courtesy, and followed
her mistress up the stairs.</p>

<p>Jewel was trembling with indefinable fear, but she
turned boldly on the delinquent maid.</p>

<p>"Now, Marie, if there is anything you can plead in
your own defense, do so quickly," she said, sharply.</p>

<p>Marie faced her with an impudent smile bold and taunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, you dare not discharge me," she replied,
coolly.</p>

<p>"Dare not!" Jewel echoed.</p>

<p>"That was what I said," replied the French maid,
calmly. "I repeat it. You dare not discharge me, for
it would be dangerous to send away the trusty maid who
shares your fatal secret."</p>

<p>She saw horror and consternation on the dark, beautiful
face. It grew pale as marble, and the eyes dilated in
horror.</p>

<p>"Ah, you understand me!" Marie said. "I confess
it was naughty in me to play ghost, but then I thought
you ought to be punished a little for that terrible deed.
She was young and lovely, the girl you killed and flung
into the cellar. You see I know all, Miss Fielding, for I
watched, and I saw you dragging her down the steps."</p>

<p>"I deny it all!" Jewel gasped, feebly; but Marie
laughed her to scorn.</p>

<p>"You deny it, with your victim lying down there under
the water in the cellar!"</p>

<p>Jewel saw that denial would be useless.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie, I did not kill her," she gasped, feebly.
"She was weak and sick; she fell down dead in my room,
most probably with heart disease. I was frightened. I
thought I might be accused of murder, so I hid the body."</p>

<p>"A very unwise thing to do, as you would not get any
one to believe that story, especially if I showed them
this," replied Marie, drawing from her pocket the piece
of bronze bric--brac, and showing Jewel a dull red stain
on its brightness.</p>

<p>She shuddered, and asked:</p>

<p>"Why have you kept the secret so long?"</p>

<p>"To forward my own interests," Marie answered,
promptly. "You will retain me in your service as long
as I choose to remain, and you will raise my wages to
three hundred dollars per month. I think that is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
reasonable, considering everything; and, besides, you
ought to be very grateful to me for keeping your awful
secret."</p>

<p>Jewel knew that this was quite true. She would have
sacrificed her whole fortune rather than that her guilty
secret should be betrayed.</p>

<p>"Does any one else know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have never opened my lips," Marie replied, truthfully;
and Jewel very gladly consented to the terms of her
silence.</p>

<p>She went to her lover, and the full glass of wine she had
taken was not sufficient to steady her nerves. She trembled
like one with a chill, and he begged her to remain at
home, declaring that the shock she had received made her
look too ill to go to the entertainment.</p>

<p>But not for any consideration would Jewel have remained
at home and left the field clear for Laurie to
linger by the side of her rival.</p>

<p>"I would not miss it for anything, and I know I shall
be better presently," she said; and went back to the parlor
and aroused Mrs. Wellings, who all this time had been
dozing in her easy-chair, oblivious to all that had happened.</p>

<p>The chaperon was sadly addicted to champagne with
her dinner, and was prone to fall asleep afterward&mdash;a failing
on which Jewel looked very complacently, since she
did not have to be bored with the old woman's droning
remarks.</p>

<p>Having aroused her to a sense of the impending festivities,
she hastily donned her warm cloak, and all three
went out to the elegant sleigh which was in readiness to
convey them over the glittering crust of snow to the grand
entertainment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>It was in a shady, flowery alcove, that must have been
designed especially for lovers, that Lord Clive was sitting
with Azalia Brooke, and by one of the strangest of
chances Laurie Meredith was close by, unseen and unheard,
yet within ear-shot of their talk.</p>

<p>It could not have been very pleasant to him to listen to
Azalia's lover pleading his cause with the lovely girl, yet
that was what Jewel's betrothed was forced to hear as he
lingered there unable to get away without attracting their
notice.</p>

<p>"I feared you would be angry if I followed you to
America, yet I could not help it," Lord Clive said, plaintively,
presently, and Azalia's voice answered gravely:</p>

<p>"It seemed very useless. We should have been back in
England in a few months."</p>

<p>"A few months&mdash;an eternity!" exclaimed the earl.
"Ah, how coldly you can speak of being away from me,
while I was devoured by the pangs of jealousy lest some
handsome American should win you from me."</p>

<p>"That is all nonsense!" said Azalia Brooke, quite
haughtily; and Laurie Meredith sighed heavily, and
thought that he had judged rightly. She was proud of
her ancient name, and scorned the Americans who could
point to no long line of ancestry.</p>

<p>"I am glad you think it is all nonsense, but you can't
think how I have been hating these fellows over here,
Miss Brooke. I had to come. And now that I'm here
you won't send me away again as you did in London, will
you? Oh, Azalia&mdash;"</p>

<p>Passionate words followed, words of love and entreaty.
Lord Clive could be quite eloquent on the subject which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
occupied his heart, and there was one but a few feet away
who envied him the privilege of wooing sweet Azalia
Brooke, one who was almost maddened by jealous pain.</p>

<p>He listened intently for the girl's answer. It came low
and sadly:</p>

<p>"I hoped you had given up all hope of me!"</p>

<p>"Never!" declared Lord Clive.</p>

<p>"I told you last winter that it was useless&mdash;I have no
love to give you," said the sweet, musical voice, very
gently.</p>

<p>"I will teach you to love me if you will only give me
an opportunity!" protested Lord Clive.</p>

<p>The girl laughed, but the laugh had a mocking sound,
so did her voice as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Suppose I tell you that I was once taught that lesson
by another? Will you give over talking to me then of
what could never be?"</p>

<p>"Azalia&mdash;Miss Brooke!"</p>

<p>"It is true," she answered, in a bitter tone.</p>

<p>"You love another!" he exclaimed, despairingly.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay; I loved once! Put it in the past tense,
please!" she interrupted; and even where he sat, Laurie
Meredith could hear the deep sigh that heaved her breast
as she added, in a voice of passionate self-scorn: "I should
hate myself could I love him still, false and fickle as he
proved to be!"</p>

<p>Lord Clive stared at her in the most profound amazement,
startled by her unwonted emotion, but the agitated
voice went on:</p>

<p>"Yes, look at me in wonder. You have thought me
cold and heartless because I turned a deaf ear to lovers.
It is due to you that I confess the truth. I have no heart
to give, because it was wiled from me long ago by one who
valued it but for a little while, then flung it carelessly
away!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed, in the greatest wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is true," she answered; and the pathos of her voice
went to Laurie Meredith's heart.</p>

<p>"It was when you were an American girl?" asked Lord
Clive.</p>

<p>"Yes, before Lord Ivon sent Mr. Kelso to seek me,"
said Azalia Brooke. "And now you know why I despise
love and lovers, Lord Clive. I have no faith in their protestations,
because I know how to rate them."</p>

<p>"You do injustice to honest lovers for the sake of one
traitor," he said, warmly. "Miss Brooke, he deserves
death at the stake. Tell me his name that I may call him
out and shoot him!"</p>

<p>A dreary, mocking laugh rippled over her lips as she
answered, simply:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is past your vengeance, Lord Clive. I
heard long ago that he was dead."</p>

<p>"It is some comfort to know that he has gone to his
reward," murmured Lord Clive, with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>He looked a moment curiously at her agitated face,
then said:</p>

<p>"I thank you for giving me your confidence, Miss
Brooke. Rest assured I shall respect it. And you will
permit me to express the sentiment that the fellow must
have been ice itself to turn cold to you."</p>

<p>She did not reply, and he continued:</p>

<p>"But all that was in the past. You look back with
scorn upon your fickle lover. Let me teach you to forget
him in a new love. Be my bride, and no wife was ever
worshiped as shall be Azalia, Countess of Clive!"</p>

<p>"I thought you would not tease me any more when you
heard my story," she said, pensively; but he vowed that
this only made him more determined to win her for his
own.</p>

<p>"You have loved before&mdash;what does it matter?" he
said. "There are few who do not fancy themselves in
love at an early stage of existence. This first love, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
is it but the light froth on the wave, shining brightly a
moment, then dissolving forever. I would be contented
to be your last love, dear, to have you say to me:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'But thou&mdash;thou art my last love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My dearest and my best!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My heart but shed its outer leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To give thee all the rest.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What a persistent lover he was, thought the irritated
listener. He wished that Lord Clive would go away, but
to his chagrin he only renewed his suit, and presently
Azalia said, wonderingly:</p>

<p>"You would be willing to marry me after what I have
told you?"</p>

<p>"Willing and happy. I believe that I could teach you
to forget the bitter past, and to love me," he replied, earnestly;
then, eagerly, "Oh, Azalia&mdash;"</p>

<p>She held out her beautiful hand to him.</p>

<p>"Then I consent for you to make the effort," she said.</p>

<p>It seemed to Laurie Meredith as if the point of a poisoned
dagger had gone through his breast. His head
drooped and he seemed dazed for a little. He came to
himself with a start, and heard Azalia saying:</p>

<p>"Now, leave me alone a little to think of my rash
promise. You may tell my great-grandpapa, if you wish.
It will make him very happy."</p>

<p>He left her reluctantly, and Laurie Meredith stumbled
out of his seat to go. She looked up at the sound, and
their eyes met, hers full of bitter triumph, his dim with a
misery she could not fathom.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Brooke. I was here when
you and Lord Clive came. I did not wish to interrupt
you&mdash;it would have been embarrassing. But had I known
I was to hear&mdash;" he paused, and she said:</p>

<p>"My bitter confession and Lord Clive's proposal, you
would have gone; but you stayed and heard&mdash;so now."</p>

<p>"I should congratulate Lord Clive, and wish you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
happy future, which I do, fair Countess of Clive to be,"
he answered, in a strained voice, and Azalia Brooke
thanked him with superb self-possession.</p>

<p>But could he have seen how the proud head drooped
when he had gone, could he have read the secret thoughts
of that tortured heart?</p>

<p>"Oh, what if he knew that I saw him there, that my
confession, my acceptance of Lord Clive were all to pique
him to return to his old allegiance? Alas, my test has
failed! I thought he was beginning to care for me again,
that somehow he suspected that I was Flower. But no,
he cares not. It is Jewel he loves, and I can doubt no
longer. That marriage was a sham, as she said, and it
was well that my baby died, poor little one, with the same
dark brand on his birth as that upon his mother's! Alas,
dare I keep my troth with Lord Clive without confessing
my shameful birth? But then, Lord Ivon has forbidden
me ever to confess the truth, so what can I do?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p>Lord Ivon and his party left for Washington the next
day, and Jewel said to herself that they did not go one day
too soon for their own good, for there was murder in her
heart toward the beautiful Azalia Brooke.</p>

<p>"If she had stayed any longer, and Laurie had continued
to show his preference for her so plainly, I believe I
should have poisoned her," she muttered, angrily, to herself.</p>

<p>She had heard with great satisfaction of the beauty's betrothal
to Lord Clive, and fearful lest Laurie had missed
hearing it, she repeated it to him with malicious delight,
eliciting the quiet answer that Lord Clive was a very fortunate
man.</p>

<p>Jewel pouted charmingly, but he took no notice. Ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
since last night he had been thinking of the words Lord
Clive had said to Azalia Brooke:</p>

<p>"It was when you were an American girl."</p>

<p>She had answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, before Lord Ivon sent Mr. Kelso to seek me."</p>

<p>Tossing on a sleepless pillow between the dawn and the
daylight, he had been ceaselessly asking himself:</p>

<p>"What did they mean? I was under the impression
that she had never been in America before."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he could not know rest nor peace
until he found out what Azalia Brooke had referred to in
her answer to Lord Clive.</p>

<p>That afternoon found him in the office of the noted lawyer,
Raynold Clinton.</p>

<p>"I wish to ask you some questions," he said. "You
were in England last winter, and you were intimate with
Lord Ivon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There is a mystery about Miss Azalia Brooke that I
wish to penetrate. It is generally believed that she has
never been in America before this time, but I think you
could tell a different story if you would."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at him, surprised to see how white
and eager his face looked.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I can not see what concern this is of
yours," he said, hesitatingly. "You are not in love with
Miss Brooke, as she is engaged to Lord Clive and you to Miss
Fielding. As for what is hinted about a mystery, Lord
Ivon does not deny that his great-granddaughter is an
American girl, although I admit that he does not care to
dwell on the circumstance."</p>

<p>"You will tell me all that you know, Mr. Clinton?
Believe me, I have a vital interest in this matter."</p>

<p>The lawyer could see that Laurie Meredith was terribly
in earnest. His sparkling brown eyes were dark with feeling,
his face pale with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, there is not much to tell," said the lawyer.
"Lord Ivon had a younger son who ran away to America,
and was disowned by his family. But his elder and second
son both died, as also his grandchildren. Then he sent
his lawyer to America to seek his disinherited son, or his
descendants. He brought this girl back, the last descendant
of the house of Ivon. 'Sole daughter of her father's
house and heart.'"</p>

<p>"Her name?" Laurie demanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Azalia Brooke," replied Mr. Clinton.</p>

<p>"You are sure, quite sure, Mr. Clinton?"</p>

<p>"That is what I was told," replied the lawyer, with so
truthful an air that the listener could not doubt him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can tell me where she lived before Lord
Ivon's lawyer found her, Mr. Clinton?"</p>

<p>"It was in the South. I do not remember the name of
the place. Indeed, I am not sure I ever heard. It was
not talked about much, because Lord Ivon seemed to have
a marked distaste to the subject."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your information, Mr. Clinton. I
shall make no improper use of it, yet there may be a startling
<i>dnouement</i> to the story you have told me. If so, you
will understand what brought me here to-day," the young
man said, with an earnestness that impressed the lawyer
very much and made him very curious.</p>

<p>But Laurie Meredith went away without confiding anything,
for he felt that such a step would be premature.</p>

<p>But his brain was reeling with the wild suspicions that
chased each other through it.</p>

<p>"I am almost persuaded that the girl is Flower herself!"
he thought. "Yet, in that case, she knows me&mdash;knows
me as the husband for whom she ceased so soon to
care, and secure in her fancied sure disguise, laughs at me
and my love&mdash;even pledges her faith to another before my
eyes! Who could have believed that lovely, gentle little
Flower could be so heartless and wicked? Will she dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to marry him, knowing herself bound to me? Yet she
told him her lover had proved false, and that she had
heard that he was dead. What if there has been treachery
somewhere? Jewel&mdash;she has loved me always, and
there has been something of the tiger-cat in her jealousy
of Azalia Brooke. What if&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could think collectedly no longer, but flung himself
down on his bed, while wild, blissful visions chased
each other through his brain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jewel was expecting her lover that evening, and he
came promptly. She thought she had never seen him so
handsome, his brown eyes were so bright, his cheeks glowing
with feverish color.</p>

<p>Artfully he led her on to talk of her past life, and at
last said, curiously:</p>

<p>"Do you know, dear Jewel, that you have never told
me the name of your birthplace?"</p>

<p>"It was Springville, Georgia," she replied, without a
suspicion of the anxiety with which he awaited her reply.</p>

<p>But when he talked on indifferent subjects awhile, he
took leave, and the next day she was astonished to receive
a short note from him, bidding her a hasty adieu, as he
had been called away from the city for a few days on a
matter of business.</p>

<p>"He has followed <i>her</i>&mdash;he has gone to Washington to
be near Azalia Brooke!" she exclaimed, angrily; and her
eyes blazed with such intense jealous fury that she seemed
on the point of going mad. A terrible purpose began to
form in her mind.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p>Jewel ordered her carriage, dressed hastily, and was
driven to the residence of Mrs. Meredith.</p>

<p>That lady and her daughters were sitting cozily in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
warm, luxurious morning-room, each engaged in a fascinating
piece of fancy work, when Jewel was shown into
the room.</p>

<p>The handsome elderly lady and her two placid, brown-eyed
daughters presented quite a contrast to the visitor,
who burst impetuously into the room with crimson cheeks
and blazing eyes, and, scarcely waiting for the customary
greeting, exclaimed in an excited voice:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Meredith, where has Laurie gone?"</p>

<p>"My dear Jewel, what is the matter? You look as if
something dreadful had happened," exclaimed the matron.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed you do," chimed in Edith and Io, as both
came up to her in consternation.</p>

<p>"Something <i>has</i> happened!" Jewel cried, angrily. She
flung herself into a cushioned chair, and continued:
"Laurie has proved false to me! He has followed that
girl to Washington!"</p>

<p>She flung his note into Mrs. Meredith's lap, and the
stately matron adjusted her glasses in great trepidation,
and ran over it quickly.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Jewel, he does not say anything here
about going to Washington. He says, called away on business,"
she remonstrated, gently.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! a blind, a weak, transparent excuse!" Jewel
answered, in a sharp, high-pitched voice. "Pray tell me
what excuse he made to you!"</p>

<p>The warm color mounted to Mrs. Meredith's cheek at
this haughty arraignment; but making excuses to herself
for the girl's excitement, which evidently arose from jealousy,
she answered:</p>

<p>"He told me that he was called South by some very important
business, the nature of which he could not explain
until his return."</p>

<p>"Humph, I should think not! He was ashamed to
confess to his mother that he was running after another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
girl, leaving his betrothed at home to fret her heart out!"
sneered Jewel, so bitterly that Io Meredith exclaimed, resentfully:</p>

<p>"Jewel, I think you ought to be ashamed to accuse my
brother of such disgraceful conduct. I would have you
understand that he is a gentleman, not a dastard!"</p>

<p>"Let me alone, Io Meredith! I shall say what I like
about your brother! He is behaving shamefully! Do
you think I did not know that he was madly in love with
Azalia Brooke? He showed it so plainly that every one
noticed it. You can not deny that!"</p>

<p>No one spoke, for Jewel's shot told. It was quite true
that Laurie Meredith had betrayed so much interest in the
lovely English girl as to excite comment. His mother
had remonstrated with him gently but decidedly.</p>

<p>"I can not help myself. It is fate," he had answered,
in such a despairing voice, and with such a miserable look
that she had not the heart to pursue the subject further,
although quite sure that his interest in Azalia Brooke was
so strong as to be a wrong to Jewel Fielding.</p>

<p>"It will wear off, this sudden fancy, when sweet Azalia
is gone," she thought to herself; and it was with a feeling
of relief that she heard of the betrothal of Azalia and
Lord Clive.</p>

<p>She asked herself anxiously now if it could be true, as
Jewel suspected, that her son had followed Azalia Brooke
to Washington. Her heart said no, for although he had
been weak enough to lose his head over her despite his engagement
to another, she felt assured that his passion had
been hopeless from first to last, and that he had struggled
against it in vain.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling sorry for her son and for the
dark-eyed girl who loved him with such jealous passion.</p>

<p>With it all there was mixed a little self-reproach, for
had she not pitied Jewel so much that she had persuaded
her son to make an effort to return the girl's affection?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of her anxiety had grown that engagement. He
had yielded to her wishes, engaged himself to Jewel, and
here were the consequences.</p>

<p>He had been too hasty, and when the girl, whom he
could have loved with his whole heart, crossed his path, it
was too late.</p>

<p>"And he might have won her, who knows?" she
thought; for her keen eyes had noted that Azalia Brooke
took a secret and curious interest in Laurie Meredith.</p>

<p>But something must be done to soothe the excited
Jewel, and after a moment's silence, the matron said,
gently:</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I am sure that you wrong Laurie by
your suspicions. He is too honorable a man to deceive
you and outrage your affections in such a cruel manner.
I am convinced that he has gone South, as he stated to me,
and that you will soon hear from him at a distance from
Washington."</p>

<p>"And I am quite sure that he has gone to Washington,
madame, to be near the girl I hate so bitterly, and I came
here to inform you that I intend to follow him within
twenty-four hours!" replied Jewel, with startling emphasis,
springing to her feet and beginning to walk rapidly
up and down the long room with swift, graceful movements
that reminded the Merediths of the sinuous grace of
the beautiful, deadly tigress.</p>

<p>These cultured, highly refined ladies gazed in amazement
and consternation at Laurie's betrothed, and Edith
cried out, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Really, Jewel, you must be out of your senses! What
will people say?"</p>

<p>The beautiful pantheress paused a moment in her wild
walk, and gazing at the speaker with lurid eyes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That will depend upon your mother and you, Edith
and Io. If she will consent to go with me to Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
taking you with her, no one can say anything. If she
will not go, people will say that I was wronged and jealous
and that I went after my recreant lover."</p>

<p>"Jewel, you must not go!" Mrs. Meredith exclaimed,
with mixed entreaty and command, but the girl laughed
wildly.</p>

<p>"I will go, if I die for it," she said, fiercely. "He has
driven me mad by his love for another, and I am not answerable
for what I do. Yes, I shall follow him, and if
I find him there by her side I shall be tempted to kill
them both!" and she sunk upon the floor in wild hysterics.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<p>Her jealous wrath, her wild threats, ended as she meant
they should. The Merediths were forced into compliance
with her wishes. They could not persuade her to remain
at home, and they dared not let her go alone.</p>

<p>But this terrible revelation of her mind and temper
thoroughly disgusted the Merediths, and made them anxious
over Laurie's future.</p>

<p>"Who would have dreamed that she was such a shrew?
Why, there was murder in her eyes as they flashed and
glowed. She will lead our brother a miserable life, I am
sure," Edith said to her sister, as they hurriedly packed
their trunks for the unexpected visit to the Capital City.</p>

<p>"Yes, and how sweet and gentle she seemed to be before
she was sure of Laurie. She was deceiving us all,
then, in order to forward her cause, and she succeeded so
well, too, for we all praised her to Laurie, and gave him
no peace until he proposed to her. How she takes on the
airs of a queen. I should not be sorry if Laurie would jilt
her outright!" Io declared, spiritedly.</p>

<p>But, reckless in her fierce wrath and jealousy of their
good or bad opinion, Jewel had gone home to prepare for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
her trip. She rang the bell furiously for Marie to come
and pack her things.</p>

<p>No one responded at first; but when she went angrily
down-stairs to inquire for the delinquent, Mrs. Wellings
started up from her doze in the arm-chair to ask, stupidly:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Miss Fielding? Do&mdash;do you want me?"</p>

<p>"No," Jewel said, with a contemptuous glance at the
dull face, "I want Marie!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Wellings.</p>

<p>"Do you know where she is?" continued Jewel, with
wild impatience.</p>

<p>"No, I do not, I'm sure," said the only half-awakened
woman. Then she started and muttered, "Oh, I forgot,
she came in here soon after you went away. She was
dressed for going out, and she gave me this letter to hand
to you as soon as you returned," placing a sealed envelope
in Jewel's eagerly outstretched palm.</p>

<p>Jewel was terribly afraid of the maid who held her
awful secret in possession. She ran upstairs with a wildly
throbbing heart, wondering what her absence and the letter
combined could mean.</p>

<p>But she would soon know; for her nervous fingers
eagerly tore the end of the envelope across, and her blazing
eyes soon devoured the contents, which stated, in an odd
<i>mlange</i> of French and English, that the writer feared to
remain any longer in her employ, as she did not consider
her life secure while in the power of a lady whose deadly
secret she held. She had been joking about the three
hundred dollars per month wages, as no sum could have
been large enough to tempt her to stay. She had made
arrangements to enter the service of a young English lady,
and would be gone before Miss Fielding's return. Lastly,
she would ease Miss Fielding's conscience by telling her
that the poor girl she had flung into the cellar was not
dead&mdash;only stunned&mdash;and that she, Marie, had resuscitated
her and helped her away. If Miss Fielding would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the trouble to look in the cellar, she would see for herself.
Lastly, Miss Fielding need not be afraid that Marie would
betray her sin to the world, as she had faithfully promised
the golden-haired lady that she would keep the secret.</p>

<p>Marie did not add that a bountiful golden bribe had
bought her silence; but Jewel readily guessed it, knowing
the French girl's cupidity. She tore the letter into a hundred
fragments after she had impressed its contents on her
furious brain, and for a few moments her wrath was something
fearful&mdash;so near akin to madness that it recalled to
her mind the terrible spells of her mother in those first
days after she had discovered her rival's child to be blue-eyed
Flower, whom she had always loved best in her secret
heart, because of the two girls, she resembled her father
most&mdash;the man whose memory Mrs. Fielding had alternately
loved and hated.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>


<p>Frightened at the thought of going mad, Jewel ceased
her wild raving, and tried to look her fate fairly in the
face.</p>

<p>One of the first conclusions to which her mind leaped
was that Azalia Brooke was no other than her half-sister,
Flower. She had come to see her in disguise that night,
pleading poverty, when in reality she had been the heiress
of Lord Ivon and the toast of the city. Ah, and Jewel's
hand clutched at the empty air in impotent passion, how
she regretted that her work had failed her that afternoon,
and that Marie had rescued her victim from death! It
was well indeed for cunning Marie that she was out of
reach of Miss Fielding's vengeance.</p>

<p>But, Jewel asked herself, wonderingly, why had not
Flower claimed her husband? She had certainly recognized
him, and she knew that it was his father's death she
had read in the paper that terrible night. Why then had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Flower kept the secret of her identity, and even betrothed
herself to another?</p>

<p>Jewel's mind could furnish but one solution to that
strange problem.</p>

<p>Flower had been adopted in some mysterious manner by
the old nobleman and his wife, and was ambitious of shining
in the world. She doubted whether she had ever been
really Laurie's wife, and did not wish for him to recognize
her, fearing that it would ruin her brilliant prospects in
life. She intended to let Laurie Meredith believe her
dead, while in reality she would be alive, the wife of an
earl, one of the most beautiful countesses in England.</p>

<p>Jewel choked with anger at the thought of the despised
Flower attaining such lofty heights, but even that was
better than to reveal herself to Laurie Meredith.</p>

<p>"Yes, far better, for I would rather have him than a
king!" she thought, that stormy love of hers always rising
superior to every other ambition. She decided that
she would go to Washington, seek an interview with
Flower, and tell her that she recognized her, but would
keep her secret if she would return at once to England
and marry Lord Clive. If she refused, and the beautiful
face grew dark with passion at the thought, Jewel told
herself, in a vindictive whisper, that her rival must be removed
at all hazards from her path.</p>

<p>Her plans thus laid, she called in the house-maid to assist
in packing her trunks, picturing to herself the alarm
of her lover when he should find that she had followed
him to Washington.</p>

<p>"I will make him understand, once for all, that I am
not to be trifled with by any one," she told herself, angrily,
and with a bitter wonder at her failure to win
Laurie Meredith's heart.</p>

<p>"And I so beautiful, so wondrously beautiful," she
thought, pausing a moment to gaze at her reflection in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the glass&mdash;at her flashing dark eyes, her red lips and
cheeks, her braided coronal of purplish jet-black hair.</p>

<p>"I am beautiful enough to be a queen, yet I can not
win the heart of the only man I ever cared for," she
thought, with a sort of agony at her failure.</p>

<p>But every pang she suffered only made her more determined
to triumph in the end.</p>

<p>"Only let me get Flower out of the way, and I may
win him yet. I was near to it when she came, and surely
I can recover my lost ground some day," she said.</p>

<p>She was driven in her carriage to Mrs. Meredith's, and
found them waiting, although they hoped that she would
change her mind even at the last moment.</p>

<p>But no, Jewel took her seat in the train as grim and implacable
as fate itself, and determined as ever to make all
else on earth yield to her imperious will and desire.</p>

<p>The Merediths, thoroughly disgusted at her jealous
freak, sat with her; but there was very little said by any
one. But Jewel scarcely noticed the constraint and silence
of Laurie's mother and sisters. She was completely
wrapped up in her own dark thoughts, and remained so
until they reached the end of their long journey.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</a></h2>


<p>Lord Ivon and his party had been in Washington a
week, when they became aware that the Merediths, with
Miss Fielding, had also arrived in the city.</p>

<p>It was on one of Patti's nights at the opera that the
two parties became aware of each other's presence in opposite
stage-boxes. Their first start of surprise was succeeded
on either hand by amicable nods of pleased recognition.</p>

<p>This was Jewel Fielding's rle, and she had insisted on
its being carried out to the letter by the Merediths. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
did not desire that any one should know yet of her fierce
jealousy of Azalia Brooke. Time enough yet, she said.</p>

<p>They had been in the city one day and night, and careful
inquiry revealed the fact that the absent Laurie was
not in this city. The Merediths were jubilant, but Jewel
would not allow them to boast over their triumph.</p>

<p>"He will come yet, if Lord Ivon's party stays here any
time," she said.</p>

<p>And it occurred to her that she must hasten to get rid
of her lovely, blue-eyed rival before the return of Laurie.</p>

<p>The color leaped to her face, and her heart throbbed
with fierce anger when she first beheld Azalia Brooke sitting
in the opera-box with Lord Clive by her side, and
Lord and Lady Ivon in the background.</p>

<p>Azalia's loveliness shone with all the luster of a beautiful
pearl from her shining robe of silvery-blue satin and
misty lace, and her perfect identity with the Flower Fielding
of old struck her half-sister more strongly than ever.</p>

<p>"How could I ever have been fooled for a minute into
doubting her identity? The resemblance is perfect, complete,
and it is wonderful that Laurie has not recognized
her, and taxed her with it," she thought.</p>

<p>She had taken pains to convince herself of the truth of
Marie's story. She had peered into the old cellar, which
was clear of water now, during a spell of continued clear
weather, and she had seen no body of a murdered girl
lying there in ghastly decay, but only the old black water-proof
cloak, which, floating on the top of the water, had
so deceived her before. Of course, her wily foes had left
it there for that purpose, as she well knew now.</p>

<p>After her one smile and nod at the party in the other
box she sat silent, glowering at Patti, who was enchanting
the vast house with her exquisite voice. Jewel scarcely
heard it at all. She was listening to other voices, impish,
seducing ones, which said:</p>

<p>"You ought to crush that girl from the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
earth. You will never have any peace until you do, for
she is the evil genius of your life. Why hesitate or falter?
It was born in you both to hate each other. Your mothers
were rivals and foes. Her mother wrecked the peace
of yours. Will you let this girl, with her siren glance,
cross your path with the same fatal intent?"</p>

<p>Lord Clive, when he could spare a glance from Azalia
or the <i>diva</i>, looked at the handsome trio in the opposite
box, and presently he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Fielding is not as handsome as she was in Boston.
She seems almost to have grown thinner, and her
eyes, though bright, have a worn, haggard look, and her
expression is strange and hard. Do you observe it,
Azalia?"</p>

<p>Azalia was obliged to answer in the affirmative. No
one could deny the change that terror and unrestrained
jealousy and passion had worn in distinctive lines on
Jewel's beautiful lineaments. It was too plain to deny.
She looked years older and graver than a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Azalia had grown more grave and sad, too; but she
tried to hide it from her relatives and her lover. Not for
worlds would she have had them know that she was restless
and unhappy, almost beyond all bearing, since her
constrained parting with Laurie Meredith.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling gratified when she saw the
lines of pain and unrest on the features of her cruel half-sister.</p>

<p>"She has won him from me; but she is not happy,"
was her conclusion. "I wonder where he is to-night. I
should like to see him again. False and fickle as I know
him to be, the old fascination steals over me when I look
at his beautiful, regular profile, his clear, brown eyes, and
the soft waves of hair that I used to thread with loving
fingers. Of course he came with them to Washington,
and I suppose the reason of Jewel's angry looks is because
for some reason he could not, or would not, come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
opera with her to-night. She is a tyrant, and will rule
him with a rod of iron, that half-sister of mine! Well, I
do not pity him. He may learn in time to regret <i>me</i>, and
that will be my vengeance for his cruelty!"</p>

<p>She sighed bitterly; and Lord Clive, who had been looking
into the opposite box, started, and turned back to look
at her.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for my inattention, dearest," he
murmured, tenderly.</p>

<p>Azalia threw off her depression, and answered, gayly:</p>

<p>"I shall be quite jealous of Miss Fielding if you continue
to gaze at her with such admiring eyes."</p>

<p>His blue eyes gleamed with pleasure at the bare idea of
jealousy on the part of this cold, proud fiance.</p>

<p>"I was not even looking at Miss Fielding," he protested.
"It was the elder Miss Meredith that attracted my
attention. My dear Azalia, the girl, with her brown eyes
and tawny hair, and that stately carriage, is really a
beauty. She reminds me of the Duchess De Vere, one of
the loveliest ladies in London."</p>

<p>Azalia looked with pleasure at stately Edith Meredith,
and also at the pretty and <i>petite</i> Io. Both had a look of
Laurie that always made her traitor heart beat quick and
fast.</p>

<p>All the evening her anxious eyes kept straying to the
box. Would he not come in during the whole time?</p>

<p>No, he did not come, to her bitter disappointment; and
the next day she heard, with surprise, that he had not accompanied
his party to Washington at all, but had gone
South on some important business.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</a></h2>


<p>Face to face with her half-sister at last, with all pretenses
laid aside, Jewel had never spent a more uncomfortable
hour in her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>She had sent a note requesting a private interview the
day after the meeting at the opera, and Azalia Brooke had
granted it on the condition that her maid should be present at
the interview, stationed in an anteroom with doors open
between, so that she could see if not hear all that passed.</p>

<p>Jewel had to consent to the humiliating condition; and
when she made her appearance was not surprised to find
her runaway Maria seated complacently in the anteroom
with a malicious grin upon her pretty face.</p>

<p>"She knows so many of our secrets already that I
thought it would not matter having her here as a precautionary
measure for my own safety," Miss Brooke proclaimed,
frankly; and as Jewel frowned darkly upon her,
she added, coolly: "Yes, I am Flower, as you charged in
your note; but I would not own it to you, only that I
know you are as anxious to keep my secret as I could be
myself."</p>

<p>"You do wish to keep it, then?" Jewel sneered, vindictively.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish to keep it," the other answered, and a
passionate despair thrilled in her low, sweet voice. "Lord
Ivon is very proud, and it is hard for him to bear the stain
upon my birth. I think it would kill him if he knew that
other dark story of man's deceit and betrayed love."</p>

<p>"Tell me how and where you met Lord Ivon, and why
he adopted you," her half-sister said, curiously; and in as
few words as possible Azalia Brooke related the story.</p>

<p>"So you really are related to that distinguished family?"
her half-sister exclaimed, in palpable chagrin.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have a horror of their ever knowing the
whole of my sad story, so I have deceived them, but it is
for their own good."</p>

<p>Jewel could not repress a sneer, as she said:</p>

<p>"I thought you too goody-goody to deceive them so,
although I remember now that you kept your intimacy
with Laurie Meredith hid to the last from your mother, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
you then believed her to be. But do you really intend to
carry your brazenness so far as to marry Lord Clive without
confessing the truth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jewel, I can never marry Lord Clive! I never
meant to do it, but I promised it to pique Laurie, to force
him to a self-betrayal, if possible. He was sitting near by.
Lord Clive did not know it, but I did. I thought if
Laurie loved me still, that if I were really his wife, he
would claim me at once. And so&mdash;Heaven forgive me&mdash;I
toyed with a man's heart just as mine had been treated.
I promised to marry Lord Clive, and when I found that
Laurie did not care, I almost died of chagrin and repentance.
Of course, I can never marry Lord Clive&mdash;I, with
my soiled fame and broken heart, but day by day I put
off the telling&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;he loves me so, and it
is so hard to wound him&mdash;him, and those good people who
have taken me to their heart, forgiving the dark stain
upon my birth."</p>

<p>"You are a fool, Flower Fielding, as I've often told
you before. Why, there's nothing to prevent your marrying
the man. I will keep your secret if you will go
back to England and marry him."</p>

<p>"I can not do it," Flower answered, sorrowfully.
"Even if there was nothing else, it would be a sin to
marry him, with my heart full of love for another."</p>

<p>"Another man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jewel," and the girl suddenly fell down upon
her knees before the frowning, dark-faced beauty. "Oh,
my sister," she wailed, "have you not guessed my bitter
secret? I love Laurie still, in spite of my wrongs, in spite
of my pride! Oh, tell me, is it really true that I was
never his wife, or have you deceived me? Have you both
deceived me, because he grew weary of me so soon? How
did you win him from me after all his vows?"</p>

<p>Jewel gazed into the tear-wet, suppliant face, with
anger and consternation. It was worse than she thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Her sister actually dared to love Laurie Meredith still!
Why, she was courting her doom by that candid avowal!</p>

<p>And, as if to incense her still further, the unhappy girl
continued, wildly:</p>

<p>"I know I ought to hate him, but I can not do it, no
matter how hard I try; and I think it is because I can never
seem to comprehend him as he really is. My love seems
to glorify him and make him better than other men, while
in reality he is worse. But I have loved him so&mdash;and he
was the father of my child, you know, Jewel, and it was
such a lovely little baby! Oh, Jewel, could you but have
seen my little Douglas, with his own papa's lovely brown
eyes, you must have loved him, and been kinder to me.
It was not my fault Laurie loved me first."</p>

<p>"Hush! Get up!" Jewel hissed, with such murderous
fury in her face and glance that her half-sister started up
in terror of her life, and retreated toward the anteroom.
"Come back, you coward!" Jewel exclaimed, harshly,
"I am not going to kill you, unless you talk to me in
such a strain again. But if you did, and there were a
hundred present, I believe I should fly at you."</p>

<p>Flower shivered through all her slender frame at those
cruel words, and sunk down sobbing bitterly into a chair.</p>

<p>Jewel glared at her in fierce displeasure, a few moments,
then said, in low, cutting accents:</p>

<p>"You had as well go back to England and marry your
grand lover, for Laurie Meredith is as dead to you as if the
grass was indeed growing on his grave. Do you think he
did not recognize you? He laughed with me about it, and
said that he had half a mind to give Lord Clive a hint of
your character. I persuaded him not to do so, telling
him it was unfair after the way he had treated you."</p>

<p>"He could say that? Oh, my God! he could menace
me like that?" Flower whispered, with a strange gleam
in her dilated eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he could do so. That is nothing. It is the way
of men," Jewel replied, indifferently.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a></h2>


<p>She went away at last, having utterly failed in all her
efforts to cajole Flower into a solemn promise to marry
Lord Clive.</p>

<p>"I could not deceive him so, and I am too proud to
confess my bitter secret to him; so, in a short while I shall
break my engagement," the girl said, with sorrowful
firmness.</p>

<p>Jewel repressed all expression of her hate for her half-sister
as much as possible. She wanted to be on good
terms with her in order to further her own nefarious designs.</p>

<p>But it was very hard to keep her temper when the poor
girl, meekly dismissing her own grievances, asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Jewel, do you ever go to see mam&mdash;I mean your
mother?"</p>

<p>"No, never! I stood her ravings at home until I became
almost as mad as she was, and I have no fancy for a
second experience! The doctor keeps me posted as to her
condition."</p>

<p>"But, Jewel, will you not go and see her once? I do
not believe she is mad now, for even so long ago as that
day in the grave-yard she seemed to me almost sane.
And, with kind treatment, she ought to have been cured
by this time. Poor soul! I feel so sorry for her. I can
not forget that she gave me a mother's love for seventeen
years."</p>

<p>"The doctor never told me of her escape that time,"
Jewel said, angrily.</p>

<p>"He looked like a bad man," Flower said. "Perhaps
she is in her right mind now, and you ought to take her
away into a pleasant home and make her life endurable."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>An angry frown drew Jewel's brows together.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop your preaching!" she exclaimed, impatiently.
"Mamma is incurably insane, and will never come
out of that asylum alive!" and with that she took her
leave, smiling wickedly as she went along the broad corridors
of the large hotel.</p>

<p>Flower began to pace quickly up and down the room,
but was arrested by Marie, who caught her arm and held
her back.</p>

<p>"Look there upon the floor, Miss Brooke," she said.
"Ah, she was vair cunning. She thought we did not see
her place the little box under the chair, when she stooped
to arrange her skirts! Ugh, it is no doubt a dynamite
bomb!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no, Marie, she could not do <i>that</i>, and she my
half-sister!" shuddered Flower.</p>

<p>"And your rival," added the French maid, knowingly.
"See, mademoiselle, you will come into the anteroom. I
will open the back window which looks down on a brick-paved
yard. There is no one near. Wait, I will bring
the little box very careful, afraid of my life. I toss it
from the window. See!"</p>

<p>The box, only half as long as her hand, a simple, innocent-looking
thing, was hurled quickly from the window.
There was the swift sound of a crash on the pavement,
followed by a loud explosion. Marie shut down the window
with a bang, and caught the trembling figure in her
arms.</p>

<p>"You understand, ma'amselle, that your rival is fully
determined to sweep you from her path," she said, warningly.
"If you had struck your little foot sharply against
that box in walking, or drawn forward the chair over it,
there must have been an explosion that would have ended
both your life and mine!"</p>

<p>Flower shuddered and hid her pallid face in her hands,
wondering at the wickedness of her half-sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I was watching very close," Maria continued,
complacently. "This is twice I've foiled that wicked
woman. You must look to yourself, my gentle-hearted
lady, for terrible danger lurks near you. She fears and
hates you, and she will keep on trying to kill you. If you
take my advice you will deliver her up to the authorities."</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I do that? She is my sister! Besides,
<i>he</i> loves her, Marie!" Flower sighed.</p>

<p>"And shows vair bad taste, in my opinion, ma'amselle,"
the maid replied, candidly, and added, "and you
show vair poor judgment in letting her go free."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Azalia Brooke was touched by the devotion of the
pretty maid to whom she was thus a second time indebted
for the preservation of her life. She believed that the girl
was really fond of her and true to her, and in spite of her
lowly position she regarded her as a valued friend.</p>

<p>She had rewarded her handsomely for rescuing her from
the terrible cellar to which Jewel had cruelly consigned
her, and the grateful girl had been eager to quit the service
of the mistress she feared for that of the beautiful,
gentle English girl.</p>

<p>Little by little she had become acquainted with much of
the history of the two girls, and now it crossed the mind
of Azalia to confide all to her, under a pledge of secrecy.</p>

<p>"Marie is so bright and clever that perhaps she may
suggest something that will throw light on my dark fate,"
she thought.</p>

<p>So the piteous story of her girlhood was told with bitter
sobs and raining tears to the good Marie, who listened with
pity and sympathy for the lovely young victim, and deep
indignation against the foes who had wronged her so heartlessly.</p>

<p>"And you were his wife&mdash;Mr. Meredith's wife? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
dare he then think of making Miss Fielding his bride?"
she demanded, in her excitable <i>mlange</i> of French and
English so impossible to reproduce on paper, pieced out
as it was with expressive gestures.</p>

<p>"I believed myself his wife," Azalia said, with burning
cheeks; "but Jewel declares that he deceived me, that the
marriage ceremony was a sham. Perhaps it was, else how
dare he betroth himself to Jewel beneath my very eyes?"</p>

<p>Marie's twinkling dark eyes looked up with a strange
gleam.</p>

<p>"He may not recognize you under this new name&mdash;he
may believe you dead," she said.</p>

<p>"But Jewel has told me that he did recognize me,
Marie."</p>

<p>"Pouf! Miss Fielding's statements are not to be taken
for the truth," Marie answered at once, contemptuously;
then she added, thoughtfully: "But the marriage paper
he gave you&mdash;I should like to know who stole that."</p>

<p>Azalia could not help owning that she had always suspected
Jewel, and almost ere the words left her lips Marie
sprung to her feet, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't I think of it before?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course she has them, for she has some papers that I
have seen her gloating over several times, with such a happy
face, that I thought they were love letters! But now I
do not doubt that they were the papers you speak of&mdash;your
marriage-certificate, and perhaps the diary of your
dead father that she stole from the cabin of the mulatto
Sam."</p>

<p>Azalia's beautiful, despairing face flushed suddenly with
hope.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie, if we could only get possession of those
papers!" she exclaimed, eagerly.</p>

<p>"And why not?" answered Marie, radiant.</p>

<p>Azalia flung her beautiful white arms about the maid's
neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Marie, you are a darling! You will try to get
them, I know it by your face."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall," said the maid.</p>

<p>She laughed outright at the thought of outwitting wicked
Jewel. The maid really enjoyed putting her clever powers
to use, and she at once began to devise schemes for
obtaining the papers she had seen Jewel exult over on several
occasions.</p>

<p>"But I shall have to leave your service for awhile," she
said.</p>

<p>"I will manage without you, for I am sure that Lady
Ivon will let her maid help me sometimes," said Azalia.</p>

<p>"Then I shall go back to Miss Fielding and pretend
that I am heartily disgusted with the English aristocracy,
and ask to be taken into her service again."</p>

<p>Azalia looked very grave.</p>

<p>"One hates to be underhand and deceitful," she said;
but Marie laughed her objections away.</p>

<p>"One must fight the devil with fire," she said, coolly;
and went on disclosing her plans. "If I get taken into
her service again it will not be long before I shall go
through her baggage," she said. "If I find that she has
not got the papers with her, I shall disappear and go immediately
to Boston. Mrs. Wellings is not with her this
time, so I know she has left her to keep the house and the
servants in order. It will be no trouble for me to get into
the house to visit my friend the chamber-maid, and no
trouble for me to get something I forgot when I left there.
You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, Marie, I will make you rich for this! I
am heiress to a great fortune, and you will see that I shall
reward you generously," Azalia exclaimed, gratefully.</p>

<p>Marie's face beamed with delight.</p>

<p>"Then I will send for the old <i>pre</i> and <i>mre</i> from
Paris. I will set them up in a little shop on the boulevard&mdash;what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
you call it, the avenue? <i>Bon!</i>" she cried,
jubilantly.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Marie made her appearance
at the grand hotel where the Merediths were staying, and
by an artful story contrived to ingratiate herself again into
the favor of Jewel.</p>

<p>"I will tell you a secret, but pray do not breathe it to
any one. I am but a poor maid, and no one might believe
me," she said, "but, Miss Fielding, I am afraid that
Miss Brooke has designs on my life. Last night I found
a little box of dynamite upon the door, and when I flung
it out of the window there was a loud explosion. I do
not know what I have done to her to incur her anger, but
it certainly looked as if she had attempted my life."</p>

<p>Jewel agreed with her, and took her into her employ
again, while her heart sunk with disappointment at Azalia
Brooke's escape from her clever snare.</p>

<p>"She seems to bear a charmed life. Three times she
has escaped my vengeance!" she thought, uneasily.</p>

<p>But she consoled herself with the thought that yesterday's
work had at least accomplished one good turn, as it
had brought the clever Marie back into her service. She
would have to contrive still another plan to get rid of her
dangerous rival.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.</a></h2>


<p>Azalia spent a very restless day and night after Marie
had left her to go upon her secret quest. Her mind was
busy, and her lover, Lord Clive, was nearly all the time
in her thoughts.</p>

<p>She knew that she had done him a cruel injustice in
promising to become his wife. She would never have
done so had not Laurie Meredith been so close by that she
was tempted to answer "yes" in order to provoke his
wrath and jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>She had failed most ignobly. Laurie had remained cold,
unmoved, indifferent, and there remained to her nothing
but the consciousness of having made a fatal mistake, of
having wronged the heart of another man by accepting
him only for a purpose that now recoiled upon her own
head.</p>

<p>She could never marry Lord Clive, even if she loved
him, for look which way she would she saw only the impossibility
of such a marriage.</p>

<p>If Marie found the marriage-certificate, and it proved
her legally Laurie Meredith's wife, she, the unacknowledged
wife of an indifferent husband, could not wed Lord
Clive. On the other hand, if the marriage had been only
a sham, how could she, with that cruel stain upon her,
dare to enter one of the proudest homes of old England?
Even if she could have been dishonest enough to keep the
secret, it might be found out some day&mdash;and then?</p>

<p>Azalia sunk her head in her hands and sobbed aloud:</p>

<p>"No, no, I could not bear that! I must break with
him even though he curse me!"</p>

<p>She kept her room for several days, feigning illness, but
in reality too wretched to meet the lover whose anger she
feared and dreaded so much. Her timid heart ached with
pain because of the pain she must inflict on Lord Clive.</p>

<p>But she could not feign illness always. Lady Ivon grew
impatient of her seclusion, declaring that she was only
moping, that she would be better if she would come into
their private parlor and see Lord Clive, who was always
hanging about, sending messages and flowers to his invisible
lady-love.</p>

<p>"I will come down presently. Tell him so for me,
please," the girl said, patiently; and when the door had
closed upon Lady Ivon's silken trailing skirts, she fell
down upon her knees and begged God to forgive her for
the wrong she had done to Lord Clive, and to help her to
bear his anger when she told him the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>He was waiting in the handsome private parlor belonging
to Lord Ivon's elegant suite of rooms at Willard's
Hotel, and when she came gliding in, softly as a spirit in
her long gown of rich black velvet, he came eagerly to
meet her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"My darling, I am glad you are well enough to come
out again, for I have missed you very much."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lord Clive," she said, in a constrained
voice; and evading the arms outstretched to embrace her,
she sunk wearily into a chair.</p>

<p>He followed, and sat down by her side.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have been ill&mdash;you are pale and wan indeed,
Azalia. I see now that I did you an injustice, for I half
believed, like Lady Ivon, that it was a fit of <i>ennui</i> or
the <i>dismals</i>."</p>

<p>The blue eyes turned eagerly to his face, and he could
see that she was trembling very much.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he said, compassionately, attempting to
press her hand; but she drew it quickly away, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You were right, Lord Clive. It was not that I was
sick, only dismal and wretched. Yes, I will tell you the
truth now. I was not ill, only frightened&mdash;of <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>The low voice faltered, and she stole a pleading glance
at him that mystified him even more than her words.</p>

<p>"Frightened of me! I do not understand you, Azalia,"
he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I had&mdash;something&mdash;to tell you," faltered the frightened
voice. "Oh, Lord Clive, do not look at me so kindly
for presently you will hate me! I&mdash;I&mdash;want to take
back my promise! I can not learn to love you, so I can
never marry you!"</p>

<p>When he recovered from the severe shock she had given
him he attempted to expostulate with her, to reason with
her, but all to no purpose, for she would only reiterate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
her declaration that she could never marry him, and beg
him to forgive her for what she had done.</p>

<p>His handsome blonde face grew pale with emotion.</p>

<p>"Your reasons for this strange step, Azalia?" he said
at last, haughtily, indignation beginning to work in his
breast.</p>

<p>"I do not love you," she faltered, faintly.</p>

<p>"You told me that before, yet you did me the honor to
accept my offer; so there must be some newer reason,"
said Lord Clive.</p>

<p>She began to sob bitterly, and he said, impatiently:</p>

<p>"I am waiting for your answer, Miss Brooke."</p>

<p>Driven to bay, she answered, sobbingly:</p>

<p>"I can give you no reason; for, although one exists, I
am too great a coward to confess it. I can only throw
myself on your pity and your mercy, Lord Clive."</p>

<p>"But you are not showing me any mercy or pity," he
replied, in a deeply offended tone.</p>

<p>"Am I not, Lord Clive? Then I will show no mercy
to myself. Listen, then: I am an arrant coquette. When
I accepted your offer I knew quite well that I could never
marry you. But it was to pique another, whom I cared
for, into a confession of his love that I played with your
heart. There; have I lowered myself sufficiently in your
eyes?"</p>

<p>The handsome nobleman arose, pale with passion.</p>

<p>"You have made me quite willing to relinquish all
claims upon you, Miss Brooke," he said, with haughty
sarcasm, adding, still more bitterly: "I trust your clever
ruse brought him to your feet."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no!" she cried, in a broken voice; but at that
moment the door opened, admitting Lord and Lady Ivon
and some visitors&mdash;Mrs. Meredith, her two daughters,
and Jewel Fielding.</p>

<p>Azalia rose quietly and greeted the visitors, trembling
when the hateful glance of Jewel met her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is regretting that I was not killed by the dynamite
bomb she left in my room," she thought, nervously.
"Ah, with what a deadly hatred she regards me! She
will never relax in her deadly purpose until I am dead and
out of her way."</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith came and sat down by her side, almost
furtively, in her fear of offending jealous Jewel.</p>

<p>"You are not looking well, my dear," she said, almost
tenderly, for she had taken a serious fancy to the lovely girl.</p>

<p>Azalia knew that Lord Clive was listening angrily for
her reply, and answered, truthfully:</p>

<p>"I have been unhappy over something, Mrs. Meredith,
and it has made me feel almost ill!"</p>

<p>"Unhappy! What, my dear girl, with all your blessings!"
exclaimed the astonished matron; and she could not
help letting her glance fall on Lord Clive, who frowned
and moved restlessly in his seat.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is only a lover's quarrel!" she thought, astutely;
and hastily led the conversation to something less personal
than Miss Brooke's looks.</p>

<p>There was a slight break in the conversation, and to
her horror Azalia heard Jewel saying:</p>

<p>"I know you have often wondered, Lady Ivon, why I
fainted the night when I first met your beautiful niece,
Miss Brooke."</p>

<p>Lady Ivon coughed slightly, and answered, with cool
politeness:</p>

<p>"I merely supposed the rooms were too warm for you,
Miss Fielding."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, it was not that!" said Jewel. Her handsome
head, in its plumed bonnet of ruby plush, was thrown
backward, and her eyes had a malicious light, her mouth
a wicked, defiant smile, as if some secret, exultant thought
moved her to speech.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you the reason," continued Jewel,
looking straight into Lady Ivon's face.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.</a></h2>


<p>Lord and Lady Ivon knew from Azalia's own confession
that Jewel Fielding was the cruel half-sister whose
machinations had driven her from home, but they did not
intend that Jewel should find out her despised half-sister
in this proud, lovely young great-granddaughter.</p>

<p>So they united in bestowing upon her glances of freezing
hauteur, which did not in the least deter her from her
purpose.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you why I fainted," said Jewel.
"It was because Miss Brooke was the living image of a
sister I had lost, and it startled me so that I lost my
senses."</p>

<p>No one answered, no one moved, and Jewel continued,
smoothly:</p>

<p>"It is so remarkable a likeness that it shocks me even
yet whenever I see Miss Brooke, and more than ever to-night,
for she looks pale and sad, and that was how poor
Flower looked for many days before she ran away and was
lost in the wide world, or drowned in the great sea, perhaps,
for I have never been able to learn whether she's alive
or dead."</p>

<p>Azalia made a slight movement as if to rise to her feet,
then sunk back, too weak to obey the longing that urged
her to fly from the disgraceful revelation trembling on
the lips of her fiendish half-sister. She leaned her golden
head back against the velvet chair and watched Jewel
with pleading, piteous eyes.</p>

<p>The pitiless voice went on, cruelly:</p>

<p>"I am sure that Miss Brooke there would not be disobedient
or deceitful to her guardians; but, alas, my sister
Flower was very different in spite of her angelic expression.
She had a lover of whom mamma disapproved so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
strongly that she forbid Flower ever to speak to him. But,
willful child that she was, Flower would not listen. She
met her lover in secret until he wearied of his plaything
and deserted her to the fate she had brought upon herself.
When mamma found out the truth, and realized that disgrace
had come to the proud name of Fielding, she went
mad and had to be removed to an insane asylum. Flower
ran away, and many believed that she drowned herself. I
always hoped that she had, for I preferred death for my
beautiful, willful young sister rather than that she should
have followed her false-hearted lover into the world."</p>

<p>She paused, and every one in the room drew a long
breath, then waited for her further speech.</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh that jarred painfully on every
heart.</p>

<p>"Is it any wonder that I fainted on beholding Miss
Brooke?" she continued, thrillingly. "I had hoped,
even prayed, that my erring sister was dead, and yet she
seemed, all in a minute, to start up before me, living and
smiling as in the happy days ere she went astray. Of
course, I knew that it was nothing but a resemblance, yet
it startled, unnerved me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The dark eyes were looking with strange intentness into
the white face over yonder. They saw Azalia's white
lips part, then close without a sound.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Fielding, you have told your story with such
realism that the horror of it seems to weigh me down,"
said Lady Ivon. "I am sure we all sympathize with you
in your trouble over your erring sister. No wonder the
sight of Azalia moves you so much. I could wish she did
not bear any resemblance to your unfortunate relative."</p>

<p>Jewel sneered contemptuously into her face.</p>

<p>"You are proud. You would not fancy such a disgrace
in the family," she said.</p>

<p>"No," said the old lady, spiritedly, "I should not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
it, Miss Fielding, and if I had to endure it, I should try
to keep it hidden like a skeleton in a closet; I should not
babble of my disgrace as you have had the bad taste to
do!"</p>

<p>Jewel laughed insolently, and answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew all your pride, and that made me all the
more determined to expose my deceitful sister."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.</a></h2>


<p>Every one rose simultaneously, and Mrs. Meredith exclaimed,
in a shocked tone:</p>

<p>"Jewel!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith knew nothing of Azalia Brooke's sad history.
She believed that Jewel's fierce jealousy had driven
her mad, hence her startled cry.</p>

<p>But the vindictive girl took no notice of the lady. She
turned to Lord Clive, and said, with a smile of cruel exultation:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might not have spoken, only for the sake of
saving you from a union with one so wicked and sin-stained.
I recognized my sister that night when I fainted;
but I did not intend to betray her, and would not have
done so now only that she might not deceive an honest
man into making her his wife."</p>

<p>Azalia Brooke, drooping in her chair like a broken lily,
realized then that she had made a fatal mistake in admitting
her identity and trusting faithless Jewel with her
story.</p>

<p>Her half-sister's cruel aim flashed over her mind like
lightning.</p>

<p>She hoped that her hapless victim's lover and relatives
would turn against her when they heard that disgraceful
story, and that they would cast her forth in disgrace, so
that she would be thrown friendless and helpless on the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>This, indeed, was Jewel's cruel intention, and she said
to herself that if her plan succeeded poor Flower should
never live to see Laurie Meredith again.</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Flower, hoping that she would deny
Jewel's dreadful charge.</p>

<p>Alas! that beautiful bowed head told its own story of
bitter shame and sorrow. There was nothing for her to
say. The bitter secret, kept so long, was dragged to the
light of day at last.</p>

<p>"Azalia!" Lady Ivon exclaimed, imploringly.</p>

<p>But the golden head only sunk lower in its terrible despair.</p>

<p>Lord Clive looked from the dark, vindictive face of
Jewel Fielding to that downcast, despairing one of her
persecuted half-sister. All his manhood rose to the surface,
the nobility inherited from a long line of stainless
ancestry shone in his clear blue eyes. Looking into
Jewel's face, with scorn in his eyes, he said, distinctly:</p>

<p>"Your solicitude for me was a wasted effort, Miss
Fielding, as Miss Brooke had already taken back her
promise to me. I understand her reasons now, but it
only increases my respect for her, as I am sure she was
deceived, else such an angel had not fallen."</p>

<p>At those kindly words Flower's pale face was raised,
and she said, in a faltering voice:</p>

<p>"Lord Clive, I thank you for those kind words in my
defense. You only do me justice in your belief, for I was
deceived by a mock marriage&mdash;deceived by one who might
have remained true to me only that she&mdash;my sister there&mdash;lured
him from me."</p>

<p>An exultant laugh came from those beautiful red lips of
Jewel.</p>

<p>"I warned you that I would punish you for trying to
take him from me," she said, in a hissing voice, like a
serpent's. "He belonged to me first, and you came between
us. He turned to you for a little while, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a mere fancy, as I told you, and I had my revenge when he
deserted you to your fate."</p>

<p>Every one remained silent, too shocked to speak, and
the vindictive Jewel stood in the center of the room, mistress
of the situation, evilly beautiful in her glowing crimson
robe, and with that fire of hate on her dusky face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith, with an impulse of strong womanly pity,
let her gloved hand fall softly on Flower's, and rest there,
clasping it with tender pity. Her two handsome daughters
stood gazing with infinite pity on the lovely girl thus
crushed beneath the weight of a sister's vengeance.</p>

<p>Lord Clive looked at old Lord Ivon who had sunk back
into his chair ghastly pale, and muttering incoherently to
himself, dazed by the shock he had received in learning of
the brand of deep disgrace that lay on his great-granddaughter.
The hearers shuddered, for the sound of curses
on those aged lips was something unseemly and unfitting.</p>

<p>Lord Clive saw that the old man, bowed so low beneath
age and sorrow, was in no fit state to defend the outraged
honor of the house of Ivon. His decision was at once
taken, and crossing the room with a princely mien, he
took Azalia Brooke's hand in his, and said, bravely:</p>

<p>"Azalia, I lay down the rle of lover to take up that
of a brother. The honor of one of England's proudest
names has been outraged by a dastard too mean to live,
and his life shall pay the forfeit."</p>

<p>"Lord Clive!" she exclaimed, in a startled voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I take up your quarrel," he said, sternly, and
with a deep glow on his handsome cheek. "I, your
brother, will avenge the wrong that has been done you!
I will not let an hour pass ere I seek him, the cowardly
betrayer of innocence! Quick, tell me his name, his
home!"</p>

<p>As he held her little hand he felt a quick shudder run
through her frame, and she gasped in horror:</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! you would murder him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, like a dog!" the young earl exclaimed, bitterly.
"What, shall the earth be cumbered longer with such a
wretch? His name, my unhappy sister!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she answered, with a shudder, and her blue
eyes sought Jewel's, that had suddenly grown wild and
terrified.</p>

<p>All at once the vindictive girl had realized that the
vengeance she was taking on unhappy Flower was beginning
to recoil upon her own head.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Revenge is a naked sword&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It hath neither hilt nor guard.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wouldst thou wield this brand of the Lord?<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Thou mayst find it sheathed in thine own!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jewel met the glance of those despairing eyes, and her
brain reeled with horror; she said to herself:</p>

<p>"She will speak presently, she will betray him that she
may be revenged for what she deems his treachery and
mine! Oh, God, this is the end of all my schemes! He
will be murdered through my folly, and I shall have lost
him after all I have done for the sake of his love!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Lord Clive flung the hand of Flower from him
and strode up to Jewel.</p>

<p>"Your sister will not speak. She has a mawkish pity
for that villain," he said, sternly. "But you, Miss Fielding,
have no tender scruples. Pity was left out of your
make-up, I think. So you will be glad for poor Flower's
betrayer to pay the penalty of his sin. Speak! Tell me
the dastard's name!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never!" she shrieked, wildly, throwing up her arms
and gazing at him with an appalled face. At the same
time Flower plucked timidly at his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord Clive, let it go. Do not seek to avenge
me!" she murmured, excitedly. "She will not tell you
his name! Alas! he is dear to her, too! We will never
speak!"</p>

<p>In her eagerness she forgot that by her own words she
was betraying the secret she sought to guard so jealously.</p>

<p>Who in that room but knew that Jewel's heart was set
on handsome Laurie Meredith?</p>

<p>A dismayed exclamation went up from every throat,
and Lord Clive's voice rang loudest of all:</p>

<p>"Laurie Meredith!"</p>

<p>He sprung toward the door, opened it, and before any
one could stay him passed beyond arrest, though Jewel's
voice called wildly, frantically on his name.</p>

<p>In the room which he had left there ensued a wild, excited
scene. Flower and the younger Meredith girl had
fallen fainting on the floor, Jewel Fielding was raving in
the wildest hysterics, Lord and Lady Ivon lay back in
their chairs, incapable of anything but incoherent ravings,
Mrs. Meredith and stately Io had to restrain the agony
that ached at their hearts in order to care for the others.
Lady Ivon's maid was hastily summoned, and then a physician
was called in to administer a sedative to the raving
Jewel, who in her while forebodings of her lover's death
was realizing so vividly that revenge is a two-edged sword.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.</a></h2>


<p>Laurie Meredith's trip South furnished him the desired
clew.</p>

<p>Springville was such a small place that he had no difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
in prosecuting his inquiries into the antecedents of
Flower Fielding. Every one almost in the village could
tell him something of ill-fated Daisy Forrest and the circumstances
surrounding her sorrowful death. From that
it was an easy transition to her lovely daughter, who, having
come back for the purpose of visiting her mother's
grave, had been so strangely discovered by the lawyer who
had come over from England to seek an heir for the desolate
house of Ivon.</p>

<p>It was from the old sexton himself that Laurie heard
the touching story of all that had happened by Daisy Forrest's
grave, and his heart thrilled with grief over the hapless
girl, his adored wife, thus thrown upon the charity of
the cold world.</p>

<p>"I thank Heaven that she found an asylum in her
friendliness," he said, although it was painful to think
that she had ceased to love him so long ago that now she
could meet him and conceal her identity in the fear that
he might claim her as his own.</p>

<p>"But I shall never do that, for I am as proud as Lord
Ivon's heiress, and, though I love her to madness, I will
never even see her again unless she recalls me to her
side," he mused; and then he realized, with a start, that
now he could not marry Jewel Fielding since he felt so
sure that Azalia Brooke was no other than his lost wife,
lovely, fickle, willful Flower.</p>

<p>"Poor Jewel! she will take it hard, losing me like
this," he thought, remembering her mad love with manly
pity.</p>

<p>He asked himself if he should tell Jewel what he had
discovered, and decided that he would not do so.</p>

<p>"Let Azalia Brooke keep her secret. I love her too
well to betray her even to the sister who mourns her as
dead. She may even marry Lord Clive, and believe herself
safe under the mask of Lord Ivon's heiress. If I was
wrong in binding her to me ere she fully knew her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
heart, I will atone by 'silence to the death,'" he sighed,
with loyal self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>He rewarded the old sexton most generously for his information;
then, after some grave and thoughtful minutes
spent by the grave of Daisy Forrest, he determined to return
at once to Boston.</p>

<p>But while walking back to the little hotel, a startling
thought came to him.</p>

<p>That dream of the mulatto man, Sam&mdash;what if it were
no dream, but a reality?</p>

<p>Flower had not drowned herself that night, although
Jewel had been so positive of the fact.</p>

<p>She had borne a child, his unhappy young girl-wife.
What had become of the little one?</p>

<p>If it had died&mdash;his dear little child that he had never
seen&mdash;he should like to stand beside its grave. If it had
lived, and the young mother, in her desperation, had cast
it off, he should like to have it&mdash;should like to carry it
home to his mother, and, telling her some of the circumstances
of his secret marriage, ask her to cherish it for the
sake of its lovely young mother, who was dead.</p>

<p>Yes, he would tell her that the child's mother was dead.
That would be best; no one should learn the secret of
Lord Ivon's great-granddaughter.</p>

<p>"The child will be all mine, but that fair, proud beauty
is not for me," he sighed, then pulled himself together
with a start. "I am dreaming! Of course the child is
dead. But I will go to Virginia all the same."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.</a></h2>


<p>Few of us find our cherished dreams come true, but
Laurie Meredith had that pleasure, for on Poky's cabin
floor he found his own child playing&mdash;a dimpled tot of
three years, with Flower's arch and lovely face lighted by
his own brown eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Poky did not attempt to deny the truth. She was only
too happy to see Laurie Meredith and confide to him the
whole story of her possession of the child.</p>

<p>"I lied about it before for Miss Flower's sake," she
said. "She was so terribly 'fraid of Miss Jule dat she
wouldn't 'low me to tell de trufe eben to Sam, and she
stole away, leabing de baby for dead in my arms, and Lor',
what a shock it gin me to feel, it move presently and open
its big eyes at me! 'Twan't dead at all, only smothered
like for a few minutes. Well, Miss Flower were gone den,
so I concluded to take keer o' de little one till she come
back. But, Lor', she never did come back, and I began
to think she must be dead, when one day dere came a letter
wid a money order for five hundred dollars from ober
in Lon'on. I ain't got no friends in Lon'on, and says I
to myself, 'tis from Miss Flower. She done got rich somehow,
but dere warn't no 'dress in de letter, so what could
I do to let her know dat little Douglas was alive arter all?
Nuthin', Massa Meredith, and I wouldn't never send word
to you 'cause I'se feard you wouldn't keer 'bout my sweet
little Douglas. But bein' as you has found it out, I'se
glad, 'cause how I've been worried nights thinkin' as how
'twan't right to raise that little w'ite chile along o' my
black one!" for Poky had a two-year-old, a bright image
of Sam, playing about the cabin floor.</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith took the bright, neatly dressed Douglas
in his arms and told him that he was his own papa, and
that he was going to carry him a long ways off to live with
his dear grandmamma in Boston.</p>

<p>Here Sam lounged in, and great was his delight at seeing
Laurie Meredith again, and hearing that little Douglas
was his own child.</p>

<p>"Dat's what I always thought, although Poky would
insist dat she foun' it down in de ole barn one day, and
didn't know whose chile 'twas, anyway," he said, with a
grin of delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, having found out long ago, through mysterious
hints of his clever wife, that it was Jewel who had abstracted
his precious papers, he proceeded to gratify his
spite against her by informing Laurie of the part he had
played that night in taking that important letter to
Flower and returning the answer that had so fatally
changed the current of Flower Fielding's life.</p>

<p>"Arter things turned out so strange I was allays
afeered, Massa Laurie, as how I done wrong a-giving her
de letter, but co'se I didn't know den what a snake in de
grass she was, anyway."</p>

<p>While Laurie gazed at him with dilated eyes, he continued:</p>

<p>"What makes me all de more sure dat she played me
false dat night is dis: De young pos'-office clerk, he usen to
be despret in love with Miss Flower, and last year, w'en
he died wid de fever, he 'fessed to de preacher dat he usen
to gib Miss Jewel all de letters you sent her sister through
de pos'-office, likewise hers to you, Massa Laurie. Miss
Jewel promised to marry him, but she went away to some
big city, and he nebber heerd of her no more. Lord-a-massy,
Poky, look at de man&mdash;he's a-dying!"</p>

<p>"No, I am not dying, Sam, although this shock has
driven the blood from my face," faintly uttered Laurie
Meredith. He struggled with his weakness a few moments,
then added, "My good woman, get my child ready,
for I must go at once to right the wrong that was begun
by Sam's treachery to me that night, and by Jewel Fielding's
sin. Out of my sight, man, for I feel tempted to
rend you limb from limb! Nothing saves you except that
your wife's beautiful humanity in this whole affair condones
somewhat for your sin. For her noble sake I forego
my revenge, and spare you!"</p>

<p>Laurie Meredith no longer thought of taking his
child to his mother, now that he knew that Flower had
been the victim of a cruel plot; for he began to believe
that if all could be cleared up between them, she would
gladly come back to his loyal heart.</p>

<p>He knew that Lord Ivon and his party were in Washington,
and he determined to go there with the child and
try his fate.</p>

<p>Curbing his impatience by awkward yet loving efforts
to amuse the bright, intelligent little Douglas, who
grieved after Poky and Sam, the only friends his young
life had ever known, he journeyed to Washington, and on
arriving there went at once to Willard's Hotel, where he
secured a room for himself and his quaintly dressed little
son.</p>

<p>He had heard nothing of his mother's being in Washington,
and it was a startling event to him when he suddenly
came face to face with her as he was going along a
corridor to his room&mdash;a more startling event to her, for
she flung her arms impetuously about his neck, exclaiming,
wildly:</p>

<p>"Laurie! Oh, my son&mdash;alive, alive! Thank the good
God for His mercies!"</p>

<p>He returned her embrace with interest; then drew her
into his room, and seating her in an arm-chair, said tenderly:</p>

<p>"Dear mother, this is a pleasant surprise; I did not
know you were in Washington."</p>

<p>"I came here almost two weeks ago with Jewel Fielding.
She made me come. She thought you were here&mdash;that
you had followed Miss Brooke. Oh, Laurie, dear,
how glad I am that you escaped that terrible man! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
would have killed you if he had found you. Oh, it has all
been so dreadful, and we have suffered torments about
you! But, oh, dear! my son, where did that strange-looking
child come from? Is it a ghost? I never saw it
till this minute."</p>

<p>Laurie turned to her with a serious, puzzled face, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Mother, I've been tempted to believe you were crazy,
the way you've been running on, and I fear you'll think
the same of me when I tell you this boy is my own child.
Forgive me for keeping a secret from you so long, but I've
been married going upon four years, and this is Douglas
Meredith, your own little grandson."</p>

<p>"Married?" she echoed, without half so much surprise
as he had expected, and again winding her arms about his
neck she kissed his brow, and said, solemnly:</p>

<p>"I knew it could not be true what Jewel said, that you
had wronged her sister. I knew my boy was too noble to
commit such a terrible sin!"</p>

<p>"When you have welcomed your grandson, mother, you
shall explain all this mysterious talk," he said; for he
comprehended that she had learned something of his and
Flower's sad story.</p>

<p>"It is Flower's child?" she said; and when he answered
yes she took little Douglas into her arms and fondly caressed
him while hurriedly telling her son all that had happened
since his hurried departure for the South.</p>

<p>He in his turn confided to her everything, and ended by
asking anxiously if she thought it likely that Flower would
ever care for him again when she learned the treachery by
which they had been parted.</p>

<p>"Miss Brooke is very ill, Laurie. It is a slow fever,
the doctor says. She has been in bed ever since that
dreadful scene three days ago when Lord Clive started out
to kill you."</p>

<p>"I am very glad I escaped his blood-thirsty lordship,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
he said, with a faint smile. "But, mother, are they going
to let me see her soon?"</p>

<p>"I think they will, for that clever maid of Flower's got
back from Boston yesterday with some papers she had
stolen from Jewel's trunk, and among them was the long-missing
marriage-certificate. Oh, my son, you can not
think how glad those dear old people were to find out that
Flower was really your wife&mdash;and, oh, by the way," with
a start, "this little boy, with his funny dress, and solemn
eyes, your son, dear, will inherit the title and estates after
old Lord Ivon."</p>

<p>"I can not think of that yet, dear mother, my heart is
full of my wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear boy, I know, and presently I will break it
all to her, and let you go into her room. But I have so
much to tell you, and you had better hear it first. Be
patient a little while, please."</p>

<p>"I will listen, mother, because you insist on it; but I
can not promise to be patient," he answered, gravely.</p>

<p>"But, Laurie, it is better I should tell you, for if I do
not, Flower will insist on telling all herself, and she is too
weak for that. It is only this: Among the papers that
Jewel Fielding had hidden away was the diary of that
poor, weak Charley Fielding&mdash;a book like himself, full of
good and evil. And what do you think? Why, it was
Flower's mother after all who was his legal wife."</p>

<p>"Mother!" radiantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, hurrying on. "But he treated her
badly, poor thing. It was a secret marriage, and when
she begged to have it made public, to save her fair fame,
he quarreled with her, and declared that the marriage
ceremony had been a sham. Then he married the heiress
for her money. But she was so jealous she made him repent
of his sin. Oh, it would make you weep to read the
poor, erring soul's diary, it is so full of grief and remorse,
and&mdash;well he killed himself, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he said, then his splendidly handsome face grew
dark with anger. "And to think," he said, bitterly,
"that Jewel Fielding knew all this yet could be capable of
such infamous cruelty!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith's face grew solemn.</p>

<p>"Poor Jewel, you must not think too hardly of her,
Laurie," she said, with womanly compassion. "Remember
the jealous nature and the taint of madness that she
inherited from her mother. Remember her fatal love for
you that set into active motion the wickedest elements of
her strange nature."</p>

<p>"I can remember all; but it will still be impossible for
me to forgive her all that she made my darling suffer,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"But, Laurie, dear, she is raving mad, and has been so
ever since Lord Clive went away declaring that he would
kill you for the wrong you had done to Flower."</p>

<p>"It was very noble in Lord Clive. I should have deserved
death if I had done as Jewel Fielding said I had,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"So Jewel is incurably insane," went on Mrs. Meredith.
"She believes that Lord Clive killed you, and she
hates Flower so terribly that she is always crying out for
her sister's life. Is it not horrible? But she will be removed
to an asylum to-morrow, and the physicians declare
that she will never regain her senses. But, oh, Laurie,
what do you think she did to cap the climax of her evil
deeds?"</p>

<p>"I can not imagine what more horrible thing she could
have committed," her son replied.</p>

<p>"Could you not? Well, that wretched mother of hers,
who was sent to the lunatic asylum, you know, regained
her senses more than two years ago, but Jewel, by the
connivance of a wicked physician, would not permit her
to return to the world again. Our sweet Flower found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
out through a letter that Jewel dropped accidentally,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hasten, mother," he interposes, imploringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Meredith&mdash;"so we have got her out
of the asylum. She is here with us, so changed, so penitent,
and so fond of Flower, and grateful for getting out
of her prison. She has forgiven Charley Fielding since
she read his diary, and found out all that he suffered in
his terrible remorse for his sin. But, Laurie, the only
amusing thing of all that has happened was that Io fell in
love with Lord Clive because he took Flower's part so
bravely and was going to kill you. She declares he is the
greatest hero in the world."</p>

<p>"I hope she will console him for Flower's loss; but,
mother, how you gossip when you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not wait to hear the sentence finished, but went
out, and stayed fifteen minutes, that seemed like fifteen
years to her son's impatient heart.</p>

<p>Then she came back and led him and little Douglas to
a room a little lower down the corridor. She opened the
door, and Laurie saw a lovely, pale face lying back upon
a pillow, a smile of welcome on the tender lips. With a
wildly throbbing heart he went in and closed the door.</p>

<p>Went in to find once more a love and happiness lost so
long, but regained now for all time and all eternity.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
